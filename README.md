### About the Panorama Project
This project aims to bring together a diverse group of students and members of civic organizations from around the country to collaborate on works of public-facing journalism that explore the history of bipartisanship and political polarization in the U.S. These pieces of media – blogs, feature-length articles, short stories, podcasts, and short videos – will approach the issue of political polarization from different angles, focusing on, for example, campaign finance law, the rise of social media, changes in the rules and procedures of the House and the Senate, among other topics. Crucially, each piece of media will be authored jointly, by a team of two or more students of different backgrounds and political persuasions. The diversity of perspectives on each team will offer opportunities for participants to not only encounter other ways of framing contentious issues but also to reckon with the assumptions and evidence that those who disagree with them use for their arguments.
