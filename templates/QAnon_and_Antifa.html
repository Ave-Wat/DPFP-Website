        <P class="p0 ft0">Polarization and the Extremes: QAnon and Antifa</P>
        <P class="p1 ft1">By Claire Boettcher and Karli Tellis</P>
        <P class="p2 ft2">Introduction</P>
        <P class="p3 ft1">Political polarization is running rampant in the United States of America, fuelled by fear and
            hatred as it threatens to unravel American democracy. Research suggests that political elites have been
            becoming more polarized over time, but continued studies are highlighting a phenomenon that is even more
            concerning: the American public is becoming more polarized as well. Being a member of a political party is
            analogous to rooting for a sports team- we want our side to win, and, perhaps more importantly, we will do
            whatever we can to see our opposition lose. This phenomenon of harboring animosity towards the opposing
            party, known as affective polarization, is destroying our chances at compromise, communication, and change.
            We see the implications of polarization in our daily lives, and social media isn’t helping, stoking the
            flames of political passion and allowing people to organize themselves into <NOBR>like-minded</NOBR> groups
            online. These online communities are allowing people to further polarize one another, taking their ideas to
            the extremes and, eventually, turning their thoughts into reality. These groups of people with radical ideas
            dominate mass media, with liberals citing QAnon as the source of election conspiracy theories and causing
            the insurrection at the Capital, and conservatives blaming the effects of January 6th on Antifa spies. The
            stark divisions within our country are manifesting in extremist groups that have dominated mainstream media
            since 2017, but is the situation truly as dire as it seems?</P>
        <P class="p4 ft1">We sought out to answer that question. As Fox News and other conservative media outlets paint
            groups like Antifa as the villain, liberal media such as CNN and MSNBC point to QAnon as the problem. Each
            extremist group is painted as the downfall of modern society, each seen by the opposition as the cause of
            civil unrest and the source of the country’s problems. But how is each side assessing these presumed
            threats? We analyzed the media’s response to each group, examining how liberal media talks about Antifa and
            how conservative media talks about</P>
        <P class="p5 ft2">QAnon</P>
        <P class="p6 ft1">We aim to observe how parties, party members, and media outlets accept or reject extremists of
            their respective parties. Of course, the term “extremist” is thrown out quite frequently in this day and
            age, a <NOBR>catch-all</NOBR> for any person or group someone is trying to discredit. Thus, we define an
            extremist as someone whose ideas, policy proposals, or actions do not conform to the official platforms of
            either party; an individual or group who pushes the boundaries of their party to either the political right
            or political left; or a person or group who aligns father on the ideological spectrum than the average
            member of their party. In part, we hope to understand how media and parties respond to these extremist
            groups, as well as how party gatekeeping can affect the media landscape and can alter the narrative and
            perception of these groups.</P>

        <P class="p8 ft1">QAnon and Antifa are seen as the villains of contemporary American society by liberals and
            conservatives, respectively. By assessing how each side assesses the “villain” associated with their side,
            we hope to gain insight into the political divisions within the country and understand how parties respond
            to attacks from the opposing party</P>
        <P class="p9 ft1">In October of 2017, an anonymous account entitled “Q Clearance Patriot '' posted on the
            notoriously toxic message board known as 4chan. “Q” claimed to be a <NOBR>high-ranking</NOBR> government
            official with access to classified information about the Trump administration's war on ‘the cabal.’</P>
        <P class="p10 ft1"><SPAN class="ft3">1</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">The centerpoint of QAnon ideology rests on the
                idea that a cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles control a deep state government that seeks to
                undermine the Trump presidency, mostly through media and entertainment platforms. This secret society
                supposedly consists of elitist Democrats, journalists, entertainers, and other </SPAN>
            <NOBR>high-ranking</NOBR> figures that seek to sabotage the Trump presidency.<SPAN class="ft5">2
            </SPAN>Claims have been made that people such as Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Oprah, Tom Hanks, Ellen
            DeGeneres, and even Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama are all members of this elite organization. QAnon claims
            Donald Trump was recruited by top military generals to run for president in 2016 in order to destroy this
            cabal and bring its members to justice. Trump is waging a war of good against evil that will result in the
            arrest and execution of deep state officials and restore America to greatness.<SPAN class="ft5">3
            </SPAN>This reckoning is known as the Storm, and its arrival combined with the Great Awakening (in which all
            people recognize the truth of QAnon) will usher in a new era of American prosperity.<SPAN
                class="ft5">3</SPAN>What used to be a fringe conspiracy in 2017 became a mainstream phenomenon in 2020.
        </P>
        <P class="p12 ft1">QAnon supporters' used social media to spread fake information about <NOBR>covid-19,</NOBR>
            the Black Lives Matter movement, and the legitimacy of the 2020 election.This resulted in a surge of new
            followers and widespread notoriety. Q's wide membership base includes a wide array of people ranging from
            Trump supporters to yoga moms, from Evangelical Christians to Wall Street executives. This widespread
            support has resulted in many comparing QAnon to a huge multiplayer game or religion. Believers buy into an
            elaborate fantasy game of wars, codes, and secret societies, while Q offers explanations for problems or
            feelings people are facing.<SPAN class="ft5">4 </SPAN>In December of 2020, more than one in three Americans believed that the Deep State was working
            to undermine the Trump Presidency, and QAnon membership increased over 10 times from January to August of 2021.<SPAN class="ft5">57 </SPAN>QAnon supporters have been charged with
            violent crimes including assisantion plots and kidnappings, and were among the most prominent members of the
            January 6th insurrection at the Capitol.<SPAN class="ft5">6 </SPAN>In light of QAnons increasing membership,
            let's analyze support for QAnon in Congress, the Republcian Party, and in the media.</P>
        <P class="p19 ft2">Congress</P>
        <P class="p20 ft1">QAnon has been met with mixed reactions in Congress, especially among the Republcian Party.
            Some Congress members have openly endorsed or opposed QAnon, while others have left their allegiance out of
            the public eye. Majorie Taylor Greene (Georgia) and Lauren Boebert (Colorado) are two notable QAnon
            supporters that joined the House of Representatives in 2020, but at least a dozen other Republican
            congressional candidates have endorsed or accepted the QAnon rhetoric of Trump as a guardian against the
            <NOBR>child-molesting</NOBR> democrats.<SPAN class="ft5">7 </SPAN>Greene has referred to Q as a patriot, and
            said in 2017 that "There's a <NOBR>once-in-a-lifetime</NOBR> opportunity to take this global cabal of <NOBR>
                Satan-worshiping</NOBR> pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it." When asked about
            QAnons theories last May, Boebear said in an “I hope that this is real. It only means America is getting
            stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values, and that’s what I am for.” However,
            both Greene and Boebert sought to separate themselves from QAnon after gaining a seat in the House.
            President Trump has spoken amicably about QAnon in the past, and even referred to Greene as a “future
            Republican star.” Most GOP Congressmen have not taken a hard stance on QAnon, but the campaign branch of the
            GOP has pushed QAnon theories in hopes of turning districts red.<SPAN class="ft5">8 </SPAN>Republcian
            support for QAnon is visible but it is impossible to know the depth of support for Q’s theories and goals
            within the party.</P>
        <P class="p21 ft6">While some Republican Congress members have embraced QAnon, others have vehemently opposed
            QAnons theories and the impact they have had on the Republcian party.</P>
        <P class="p22 ft1">Several GOP members have spoken against QAnon and the damage it is causing to the party.
            Representative Peter Meijer told CNN that he believe the QAnon conspiracy theory movement could destroy the
            Republican Party from within, saying "The fact that a significant plurality, if not potentially a majority,
            of our voters have been deceived into this creation of an alternate reality could very well be an
            existential threat to the party." Rep. Adam Kinzinger is another GOP congressman who has publicly criticized
            the QAnon movement, forming a PAC aimed a fighting the rise of conspiracy theories in the Republcian Party
            and providing support for <NOBR>anti-Trump</NOBR> Republicans seeking to run for office.<SPAN class="ft5">9 </SPAN>House Minority
            Leader Kevin McCarthy said that “There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party'' on Fox News.<SPAN
                class="ft5">10 </SPAN>Republican Senator Ben Sasse warned that QAnon was destroying the GOP in an <NOBR>
                op-ed</NOBR> last January, and following the insurrection on January 6th, several GOP lawmakers called
            for the party to distance itself from Trump's legacy.<SPAN class="ft5">11 </SPAN>Many GOP lawmakers have
            condemned or criticized QAnons conspiracies and are working to limit its impact on the unity of the
            Republican Party and its reputation.</P>

        <P class="p26 ft2">Party Members</P>
        <P class="p27 ft1">QAnons growing support base has been felt most strongly in the Republican Party. According to
            a Daily Kos/Civiqs Poll done in September of 2020, 56% of Republicans believe that the QAnon theory is
            mostly true, while another 23% of Republicans and 4% of Democrats believe QAnon is only partly true. Only
            13% of Republicans believe the theory is not true at all, while 72% of Democrats agree with this
            statement.<SPAN class="ft5">12 </SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">One in five Americans, and 28% of Republicans,
                agree that there is a “storm coming soon,” that will “sweep away the elites in power and restore the
                rightful leaders.” 28% of Republicans also say that “because things have gotten so far off track” in the
                United States, “true American patriots may have to resort to violence” to save the country.</SPAN><SPAN
                class="ft5"> 13</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">According to a Ipsos/NPR poll done in December of 2020, more
                than 1 in 3 Americans (39%) believe a ‘Deep State’ is working to undermine Trump.</SPAN> This belief is
            driven primarily by Republicans and FOX News viewers, though nearly half of white men and rural residents
            (49% each) agree with this as well.<SPAN class="ft5">14 </SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">Over 4 in 10 Americans who

        <P class="p32 ft2">Media</P>
        <P class="p33 ft1">Depictions of QAnon in the media have varied over time and among media outlets. Many news
            outlets began introducing QAnon as a conspiracy group in 2020, and most left leaning news sites have
            continued to define them as such amidst their rise in popularity. Left leaning or centrist news sites
            (defined by the AllSides Media Bias Chart) such as the New York Times, the BBC, Wall Street Journal,
            Washington Post, NBC, the Atlantic, CBS, NPR, AP News, and a plethora of other news sources have published
            pieces labeling QAnon as a conspiracy theory and have continued to defined it as such as coverage has
            continued.<SPAN class="ft5">16</SPAN></P>
        <P class="p34 ft1">The Atlanitc refers to QAnon as a dangerous new phase in American conspiracy theories, saying
            it is“a movement united in mass rejection of reason, objectivity, and other Enlightenment values.” <SPAN
                class="ft5">17 </SPAN>A CBS article discussing the evolution of QAnon explores some of the most popular
            QAnon theories such as the Deep State, the 9/11 ‘truther movement,’ <NOBR>anti-semtic</NOBR> claims
            surrounding ownership of world banks, and the ‘Save Our Children’' (from a secret elitist group of
            pedophiles and sextrafficers) campaign.<SPAN class="ft5">18 </SPAN>The BBC introduces QAnon as a <NOBR>
                “wide-ranging,</NOBR> completely unfounded theory,” and draws attention to the group's often <NOBR>
                far-fetched</NOBR> conclusions.<SPAN class="ft5">19 </SPAN>Liberal and centersit new sites continually
            define QAnon as a conspiracy theory/group and discredit the allegations and conspiracies the group endorses.
        </P>
        <P class="p35 ft1">
            <NOBR>Left-leaning</NOBR> and centrist news sites have framed President Trump's comments about QAnon as
            praise for the group and its mission. When asked about QAnon in August of 2020, President Trump said that he
            did not know much about it other than that “they like me very much,’. He said QAnon members were people who
            love their country and were tired of seeing violence in major cities.<SPAN class="ft5">20 </SPAN>President
            Trump has publicly refused to denounce QAnon as a conspiracy theory and has leaned into the rhetoric that
            QAnon members are patriots, an action heavily condemned by center/left news sites. <NOBR>Right-leaning
            </NOBR> news outlets such as Fox News or OAN had limited coverage of these statements and mainly focused on
            Trump saying that he did not know much about QAnon.

        <P class="p42 ft1">However, in June of 2020 Fox News published an article entitled ‘QAnon conspiracy theory
            enters politics: What to know.’ This article looks into the real world violence that has occurred as a result from QAnon rhetoric, like when the man charged with killing the boss of the
            Gambino crime family had a QAnon symbol written on his had during a court appearance, when a women inspired
            by QAnon sought to kidnap her own child, or when a QAnon believer attempted to hijack the Hoover Dam.<SPAN
                class="ft5">21 </SPAN>It even features quotes from Will Sommer, a Daily Beast (a notable left news
            source) journalist who has been reporting on QAnon for three years, and mentions other notable Trump
            supporters that have condemned QAnon. Fox has released several other articles criticizing the way the
            liberal media equates QAnon with the Republican Party.<SPAN class="ft5">22 </SPAN>Most written articles on
            QAnon by Fox News label them as a conspiracy group and attempt to distance QAnon from the GOP.</P>
        <P class="p43 ft1">Fox News anchors on television have been more hesitant to classify QAnon as a conspiracy
            group. Talk show host Tucker Carlson has stated that he believes the Left invented QAnon, and that cable
            news and politicians are to blame for the false information being spread to Americans. Carlson has also
            defended QAnon by pushing against the idea that QAnon was a real threat in the weeks before January 6th.
            Many participants in the siege on the US Capitol have admitted to being QAnon believers, including some of
            the most prominent members of the crowd such as ‘QAnon Shawman’ Jake Angeli. <SPAN class="ft5">23
            </SPAN>Carlson continued to defend QAnon after the insurrection by painting their actions as a act of
            freedom rather than treason, and on January 26th said</P>
        <P class="p44 ft1">“There's a clear line between democracy and tyranny, between <NOBR>self-government</NOBR> and
            dictatorship. And here's what that line is. That line is your conscience. They cannot cross that. Government
            has every right to tell you what to do. No democratic government can ever tell you what to think. Your mind
            belongs to you, and it is yours and yours alone."<SPAN class="ft5">24</SPAN></P>
        <P class="p45 ft6">One American News Network, or OAN (a right leaning organization), has also supported QAnon
            members. They have labeled any attempt to stop advocates for the January 6th insurrectionists as a cap on
            free speech, and even had QAnon themed emojis available on their YouTube Live streaming platform.<SPAN class="ft25">25 </SPAN>
            <NOBR>Right-wing</NOBR> cable news channels have shown strong support for QAnon compared to their written

        <P class="p50 ft2">Antifa</P>
        <P class="p51 ft1">“Antifa” has become a buzzword in mainstream media, representing a militant and violent
            organization dedicated to chaos and destruction. Public figures like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz claim that
            Antifa is the enemy, the true villain of American politics, a terrorist organization devoted to destroying
            the country. But what <SPAN class="ft26">is </SPAN>antifa, really?</P>
        <P class="p52 ft1">Antifa, short for antifascist, is a <NOBR>left-wing</NOBR> movement that has been around, in
            some form, since the 1930’s, and has roots in the American punk scene. There is no centralized authority,
            and many (not all) of those who associate themselves with the movement are anarchists or <NOBR>
                anti-government,</NOBR> support defunding the police, with some believing that the system needs to be
            dismantled and totally rebuilt to ensure inclusivity and equity. But the big question still remains: Are
            they violent? And if they are, are they as violent as conservative media claims they are?</P>
        <P class="p53 ft6">Antifa members are willing to use force and violence to achieve their goals: eradicating
            fascism in any and all forms. At their best, they are a scattered group of individuals willing to do what
            they must to fight hatred. At their worst, they are violent and counterproductive to their cause.</P>
        <P class="p54 ft1">Because Antifa is <NOBR>left-wing</NOBR> and commonly portrayed as being associated with
            progressive liberals, <NOBR>far-right</NOBR> conservatives often attribute the work of Antifa as a
            manifestation of everything wrong with liberal ideology, making Antifa a scapegoat to paint liberals and the
            left as the enemy. How are liberals responding to this? Do they support what Antifa is doing, denounce it
            altogether, or remain neutral? The answer is mixed, and varies depending which media outlets you look at.

        <P class="p55 ft2">Media</P>

        
    </DIV>
    <DIV id="page_8">
        
        <P class="p59 ft1">Broadly, Antifa is portrayed in liberal media as less of a threat than conservatives make it
            out to be, arguing that its decentralization and lack of leadership makes it a movement unlikely to do any
            real or lasting damage to American government. Outlets such as the New Yorker and Vox, rated by AllSides as
            sites with a bias towards the left, take care to highlight the movement’s lack of organization and portray
            it more as an ideology aimed at eradicating facism and racism. Quick to denounce the violence that can erupt
            from protests with alleged Antifa involvement, they highlight the movement’s other tactics in achieving their goals and cite the lack of evidence
            implicating Antifa in acts of violence. While these liberal outlets do not appear to condone what members of
            Antifa are doing, there is a clear attempt to put out the flames of passion lit by conservatives (namely
            former President Donald Trump) and characterize Antifa not as a threat or terrorist organization, but a
            movement of disenfranchised citizens advocating for an ideology they believe in.</P>
        <P class="p60 ft1">In an article for Vox in 2020, Zack Beauchamp writes ‘Antifa, explained’, detailing the
            movement’s origins and actions. The article opens with a restatement of conservative fear; “Donald Trump
            seems convinced… that antifa, a militant <NOBR>left-wing</NOBR> anarchist movement, is taking advantage of
            the [Black Lives Matter] demonstrations to burn the country down”<SPAN class="ft5">26</SPAN>. The language
            used is strong and impassioned, highlighting what many fear. However, he goes on to say that Antifa is nothing like those terrorist groups</SPAN>. It is not a unified
            organization, but rather a loose ideological label of a subset of <NOBR>left-wing</NOBR> radicals who
            believe in using <NOBR>street-level</NOBR> force to prevent the rise of what they see as fascist movements.
            It is a kind of anarchist alternative to the police that originally took root in America’s punk scene, <SPAN
                class="ft2">without any kind of national command or control structure</SPAN>” (emphasis added).<SPAN
                class="ft5">27</SPAN></P>
       
        <P class="p62 ft1">Cleverly, the author diffuses some of the terror surrounding Antifa by painting it as a
            <NOBR>non-organization,</NOBR> a movement of ideas with no clear direction or leadership. Further, he points
            out that “there is no reason to believe that antifa is responsible for [the protests’] (occasional) turn
            towards violence”, arguing “Antifa members are not responsible for the unrest.”<SPAN class="ft5">28
            </SPAN>This deflection implies that there is another cause of the violence, something not being discussed by
            mainstream media. Indeed, Beauchamp says that Antifa “are a <NOBR>trumped-up</NOBR> boogeyman for the
            conservative movement, a totem used to justify their violent ‘law and order’ approach to legitimate
            demonstrations demanding racial justice.”<SPAN class="ft5">29 </SPAN>Beauchamp flips the narrative here,
            describing conservatives as violent while maintaining that Antifa is not to blame, at least not fully, for
            the chaos ensuing at protests around the country. Emphasizing the movement’s decentralization and
            localization, Beauchamp continues to say that “the actual antifa movement is very small and, by all
            accounts, ancillary to the main story of the current waves of protests.”<SPAN class="ft5">30</SPAN></P>
        <P class="p63 ft6">Interestingly, Beauchamp says that “[Antifa’s] activity, both violent and nonviolent,
            arguably helped curtail the spread of the <NOBR>alt-right.”<SPAN class="ft25">31</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN
                class="ft25"> </SPAN>While this does not outright condone the actions of Antifa, it speaks volumes that the author would give credit to a movement that is so
            controversial as doing something beneficial for the nation.</P>
        <P class="p68 ft1">Additionally, Beauchamp notes that Antifa is not just violence and hatred, as it is made out
            to be. “Members of antifa groups do more conventional activism, flyer campaigns, and community organizing…
            This type of work… makes up the ‘vast majority’ of antifa activity.”<SPAN class="ft5">32</SPAN>By
            highlighting the more acceptable and productive methods of achieving their goals, in combination with the
            lack of evidence attributing the violence and looting to Antifa, Beauchamp challenges common misconceptions
            about Antifa. In doing so, he is able to simultaneously appease the fear surrounding the idea of Antifa
            while suggesting that it is the <NOBR>far-right</NOBR> that is the true source of violence and chaos in the
            Nation.</P>
        <P class="p69 ft1">CNN published an article in 2019 by Ganim and Welch entitled “Unmasking the leftist antifa
            movement”. Once more, liberal media takes care to highlight that Antifa is not nationally organized, but CNN
            takes it a step farther in articulating a positive goal for the movement; “Antifa activists, who operate
            <SPAN class="ft2">without any centralized leadership</SPAN>, told CNN that their goal is <SPAN
                class="ft2">peace and inclusivity</SPAN>. They often denounce capitalism and government” (emphasis
            added).<SPAN class="ft5">33 </SPAN>Describing Antifa as activists with a goal of peace and inclusivity, both
            phrases with positive connotations, counters the common perception of the group. However, this positivity
            doesn’t last very long, as the authors go on to say that Antifa’s methods are “often violent”, with members
            “willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism- as long as
            force is used in the name of eradicating hatred.”<SPAN class="ft5">34 </SPAN>Although CNN admits that
            members of Antifa use violence, their description of it as a “willingness” in the name of “eradicating
            hatred” is forgiving, and lends itself to a justification for the violence. They go on to say “Antifa
            activists often don’t hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth
            distribution.”<SPAN class="ft5">35 </SPAN>Once again, the authors seem to justify, to a certain extent, the
            activity of Antifa, while admitting that Antifa is responsible for property destruction. This justification
            continues: “Antifa members also sometimes launch attacks against people who aren’t physically attacking
            them. The movement… sees the <NOBR>alt-right</NOBR> hate speech as violent, and for that, its activists have
            opted to meet violence with violence.”<SPAN class="ft5">36</SPAN></P>

    <DIV id="page_10">
      
        <P class="p73 ft1">The New Yorker published an article, “In the Streets with Antifa”, in late 2020, detailing
            what Antifa truly is, how it came to be, and what they do. The article centers around the events of
            September 26, 2020, in Portland, Oregon, where violence erupted as both <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> and <NOBR>
                left-wing</NOBR> groups organized rallies and protests. The Antifa protest, as characterized by the New
            Yorker, was <NOBR>“family-friendly,”</NOBR> a description that isn’t typical of protests.<SPAN
                class="ft5">37 </SPAN>This description, notably in the first paragraph of the article, sets up a view of Antifa protests counter to
            popular perception: that the event is something that anyone can attend, an environment conducive to all
            ages. This notion runs counter to Trump’s and traditionally conservative conceptions of these events; rather
            than being the site of America’s demise, they are family appropriate.</P>
        <P class="p74 ft1">The author continues to battle misconceptions surrounding Antifa, stating that “most
            Americans who identify as antifascists don’t belong to any particular group, and there is no national Antifa
            hierarchy or leadership.”<SPAN class="ft5">38 </SPAN>The author continues to suggest that perhaps it is the
            <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> that is the problem; “...in response to such <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> events some
            leftists have mobilized under the name Antifa, following the tradition with specific principles, among them
            a willingness to engage in violence.”<SPAN class="ft5">39 </SPAN>Not only is the article claiming that
            Antifa is a <SPAN class="ft26">response </SPAN>to <NOBR>far-right</NOBR> groups, but beginning to suggest
            that the members of this movement are not <SPAN class="ft26">inherently </SPAN>violent, but rather they are
            <SPAN class="ft26">willing to engage </SPAN>in violent acts to protect their beliefs and their communities.
            Mogelson goes on to highlight other routes Antifa, namely the Torch Antifa Network, takes to achieve their
            goals, saying “the network focuses much of its energy on Internet activism: doing research online,
            identifying proponents of bigotry, and then publicly exposing- or ‘doxing’- them.”<SPAN class="ft5">3
            </SPAN>According to the author and his sources, this movement is much more than just violence and
            destruction, but rather actively takes steps to stop hatred in its tracks.</P>
        <P class="p75 ft1">However, there is no way to avoid the violence that tends to erupt when <NOBR>far-right
            </NOBR> and <NOBR>far-left</NOBR> groups clash. When confronted with a violent situation, Mogelson says
            “antifascist doctrine <SPAN class="ft26">does not allow </SPAN>for avoiding such confrontations”(emphasis
            added).<SPAN class="ft5">40 </SPAN>In Portland, a member of the <NOBR>far-right</NOBR> organization Patriot
            Prayer was shot and killed by a white Antifa supporter. The author, however, made sure to note that the
            shooter was “unaffiliated” with Antifa; the only connection between the group and the shooter was the
            shooter’s Instagram post claiming to support the work of Antifa.</P>
        <P class="p76 ft6">In a rather disturbing description, Mogelson describes Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson
            being harassed as he was attempting to flee Portland:</P>
        <P class="p77 ft1">“[Gibson] kept up a show of equanimity until his hat and glasses were snatched away. Soon,
            drinks were emptied on him, objects were hurled at him, eggs were smashed on him, and he was punched and
            <NOBR>pepper-sprayed…</NOBR> Someone rang a cowbell in his ears and others strobed flashlights in his eyes.
            ‘Kill the Nazi!’ someone screamed… As far as I could tell, all of Gibson’s assailants were white.”<SPAN
                class="ft5">41</SPAN></P>
        <P class="p78 ft6">When Gibson sought asylum in a gas station, “people smashed the windows and kicked open a
            side door.”<SPAN class="ft25">42 </SPAN>A <NOBR>Filipino-American</NOBR> who marched for the Black Lives
            Matter movement was there through it all, shocked at what he saw, and revealed to Mogelson that he “worried that in
            Portland [the Black Lives Matter movement] had been subsumed by the city’s militant antifascist culture,
            which he saw as violent and white.”<SPAN class="ft25">43</SPAN></P>
        
    </DIV>
    <DIV id="page_11">
    
       
        <P class="p80 ft1">Later, outside of the Portland Justice Center, a woman with a megaphone shouted to a crowd,
            “‘I just got word that the person who died was a Patriot Prayer person… He was a fucking Nazi. Our community
            held its own and took out the trash… I am not sad that a fucking fascist died.’ Everyone cheered.”<SPAN
                class="ft5">44</SPAN></P>
        <P class="p81 ft1">This depiction of the events in Portland throughout 2020 is far from a peaceful
            representation of Antifa, and highlights the hatred and division that is overtaking the country. However,
            the author takes care to point out that the face of Antifa is white; “Many of the white protestors in
            Portland subscribe to a radical political agenda.”<SPAN class="ft5">45 </SPAN>This distinction is likely a
            way to protect the validity of the Black Lives Matter movement and to counter the conservative assumption
            that those fighting for racial justice are violent; on the contrary, the article suggests that it is mostly
            white people who are responsible for <NOBR>non-peaceful</NOBR> acts of protest. Doubling back, the author
            highlights a statistic from the Center for Strategic and International Studies; “during the Trump
            administration, <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> terrorists have carried out about a hundred and forty attacks,
            <NOBR>left-wing</NOBR> terrorists a dozen.”<SPAN class="ft5">46 </SPAN>While careful to highlight the
            shortcomings and potential violence of Antifa, this statistic speaks for itself in shifting the blame to the
            right.</P>
        <P class="p82 ft2">Public Opinion and Congressional Support</P>
        <P class="p83 ft1">Unfortunately, there has been little research and reliable polling regarding public opinion
            on Antifa. In 2017, the website ISideWith published a poll asking respondents, “Should AntiFa be declared a
            domestic terrorist organization?” 64% of respondents said yes, while 36% said no.<SPAN class="ft5">47
            </SPAN>There was no available party breakdown.</P>
        <P class="p84 ft1">A survey conducted in June of 2020 by Rasmussen Reports says that 49% of respondents believe
            that Antifa should be labeled as a terrorist organization, with 30% who disagree and 22% who are undecided;
            when broken down by political party, however, we see much more division, with 72% of Republicans in support
            of declaring Antifa a terrorist organization, compared to only 32% of Democrats and 43% of those not
            affiliated with either party.<SPAN class="ft5">48</SPAN></P>
       
    </DIV>
    <DIV id="page_12">

        <P class="p88 ft1">This makes perfect sense, of course- undoubtedly, there is more coverage of Antifa and their
            actions from conservative media than there is in liberal media. And even when liberal media discusses
            Antifa, they don’t portray them as a <NOBR>high-level,</NOBR> centralized, and powerful organization capable
            of taking down the entire government; they are careful to highlight the lack of centralized leadership, the
            other types of activism they do, and their goal of ending facism.</P>
        <P class="p12 ft1">In Congress, a multitude of bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate
            (H.Res.525, 116th Congress; S.Res 279, 116th Congress; H.R.4117, 117th Congress, to name a few) put forth by
            Republican members of Congress attempting to label Antifa as a terrorist organization. None have passed.
            Many politicians, most Republican with a notable few Democrats, have denounced Antifa and their violent
            tactics. Not much information is available on the views of figures like President Biden, Senator Bernie
            Sanders, and Representative Alexandria <NOBR>Ocasio-Cortez</NOBR> on Antifa, other than describing Antifa as
            an ideology rather than a group, or condemning certain violent actions. While this might seem
            counterintuitive, it falls perfectly in line with the liberal media’s (scarce) portrayal of Antifa; by not
            paying the same attention to Antifa that conservatives do, they indicate to their audience that Antifa is
            not the threat that people may think is, but rather an ideological movement with loosely tied groups with no
            central authority. In this way, the Democratic party and liberal media distance themselves from any ties to
            Antifa and their actions.</P>
        <P class="p89 ft2">Conclusion</P>
        <P class="p90 ft1">The Republcian and Democratic parties are seemingly at war with one another. America is a
            political dystopia, with liberals and conservatives battling over a torn flag, any semblance of sanity and
            reason ripped from our citizens. Civil discourse is no longer civil, compromise is no longer calm, reason is
            no longer a reality. This lack of civility and understanding has left many Americans feeling trapped. Some
            feel they are trapped in the middle and are stuck watching the two parties shed blood to prove a political
            point, while others feel they are trapped in an extreme, fearing that the Nation will collapse if their team
            loses. There is a lot at stake here.</P>
        <P class="p91 ft6">As with any <NOBR>high-stakes</NOBR> situation, people are willing to do just about anything
            for what they believe in. Naturally, this has led to an opportunity for extremist groups to dominate the
            media and gather national attention.</P>
        <P class="p92 ft1">While neither QAnon nor Antifa represent the established, official political platforms of
            either party, they <SPAN class="ft26">do </SPAN>represent the extremities of conservative and liberal
            ideology, respectively. Each of these groups has become the scapegoat of America’s problems by the opposing
            side, depicted as the downfall of American political society. While each side spends time attempting to
            discredit one another via these extremist groups, what do the parties themselves have to say about these
            claims?</P>
        
    </DIV>
    <DIV id="page_13">
        


        <DIV id="id13_1">
            
            <P class="p94 ft1">We attempted to analyse the Republican/conservative response to QAnon and the
                Democratic/liberal response to Antifa. There were common themes: Republicans and Democrats alike attempted
                to dismiss any connection their party or ideology may have with the groups, as well as downplaying the
                propaganda surrounding the group by making them seem less damaging; for example, Tucker Carlson denied QAnon being a real threat in the weeks
                leading up to the insurrection on January 6th, similar to the ways liberal media jumped at the
                opportunity to portray Antifa as a decentralized, disorganized, activist organization- not a threat to
                our democracy. Additionally, liberals and conservatives alike were eager to point the finger back at
                their opponent, not only denying responsibility, but deflecting blame- we see this in Tucker Carlson’s
                claim that the left actually invented QAnon, and in the New Yorker article which described Antifa as a
                response to the <NOBR>right-wing.</NOBR> By avoiding the faults of their own party and actually <SPAN
                    class="ft26">utilizing </SPAN>those faults to shift blame to the opposition, the parties are
                successfully gatekeeping the media landscape. They are ensuring that their viewers only listen to the
                negatives of the other side, without having to confront their own parties’ faults. Simply put, they’re
                playing a game. And they will do everything in their power to win, without making it appear that they’re
                cheating.</P>
            <P class="p95 ft1">The issue is that, if these liberal and conservative news networks and politicians do not
                denounce the violence and extremism, those members of the party who may already be polarized may see
                little to nothing wrong with joining these groups, and what’s more, engaging in violence. Seeing as the
                public is polarizing, if enough people engage with this violent mindset, it could have drastic
                consequences for our Nation.</P>
            <P class="p96 ft1">This cycle can be broken, however. This type of <NOBR>hyper-partisan</NOBR> media only
                serves to polarize those who were already extreme to begin with.<SPAN class="ft5">49 </SPAN>Perhaps if
                Americans were introduced to a relatively neutral, unbiased, and <SPAN class="ft26">accountable
                </SPAN>news station, there would be little to no concern. There is a catch, however- people would have
                to <SPAN class="ft26">trust </SPAN>that it is neutral or unbiased, and not only that, but it would have
                to be as popular and widespread as Fox, CNN, and MSNBC: a household name.</P>
            <P class="p97 ft1">We would like to close with this glimmer of hope: changes may seem impossible if they are
                not initiated by politicians, mass media, or the government. Yet what is a Nation but a body of people?
                Think of the changes we can make in our daily lives to change the world in small but <SPAN
                    class="ft26">significant </SPAN>ways. If you truly care about what you believe in, you will do your
                best to engage with, listen to, and <SPAN class="ft26">understand </SPAN>the other side. That sounds
                extremely difficult, maybe impossible, I know- but I think of it like this. A better world only exists
                with enough people that believe in making it better. When we work together, we can accomplish anything.
                Ultimately, most of us have a common goal: a better world. If we learn how to talk to one another, how
                to understand one another, we can show each other the worlds we’ve been dreaming of and make them a
                reality.</P>
