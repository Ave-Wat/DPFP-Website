		<P class="p0 ft0">Dear Reader,</P>
		<P class="p1 ft1">We designed this course as students in search of a class we would want to take <NOBR>
				ourselves--</NOBR> a course that promoted empathy and understanding over winning and disconnect in
			debate. In witnessing the division within our country, not only in politics but across many realms, we
			wanted to gather some sort of solution that could aid in bridging this reality. We found our answer in
			education with beliefs that teaching transcends beyond awareness. That permeates into social change.</P>
		<P class="p2 ft1">After a summer of research and source gathering, we are excited and inspired to share this
			harbored syllabus template available for high school teachers’ uses.</P>
		<P class="p3 ft1">While this course is meant to function within the branches of sociology, we would like to
			emphasize the breadth and flexibility with which this syllabus expands into current events and personalized
			preferences.</P>
		<P class="p4 ft1">Therefore, while we may suggest certain topics or subjects, we would like you as the teacher
			to interact with and change what we have designed. Take note of your own bias and background as well as your
			own student population. What is important to them? What is most appropriate to teach? What needs to be
			taught? This piece of teacher reflection is crucial and will ultimately activate the base of our lesson
			plans.</P>
		<P class="p5 ft3">Throughout this process we relied heavily upon principles outlined by the Better Arguments
			Project whose website is linked here <A href="https://betterarguments.org/"><SPAN
					class="ft2">https://betterarguments.org/</SPAN></A> and whose core points of debate are:</P>
		<P class="p6 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">●</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">History</SPAN></P>
		<P class="p7 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">●</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">Historical Context</SPAN></P>
		<P class="p7 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">●</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">Emotion</SPAN></P>
		<P class="p8 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">●</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">Emotional Intelligence</SPAN></P>
		<P class="p7 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">●</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">Power</SPAN></P>
		<P class="p8 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">●</SPAN><SPAN class="ft4">Recognizing Power</SPAN></P>
		<P class="p9 ft1">From this foundation we aimed to find balanced sources that explore various sides to an
			argument, as well as teach students how to do this on their own. For example, if we wanted to teach Emotion,
			we would search for pieces that stress empathy and sympathy, but also encourage stepping outside of one’s
			comfort zone. The information we present in this case could be a documentary or ethnographic film that
			reveals one subjective sociological experience</P>
	</DIV>
	<DIV id="page_2">


		<P class="p10 ft1">like poverty or water insecurity for example. This portion could even be music or art as they
			force the mind to activate its humanity.</P>
		<P class="p11 ft1">A main intention of this course is to step away from the pragmatic lesson plans of reading
			and writing. As students ourselves, we want material that is not only different, exciting, and interesting,
			but that which truly sticks with us on a deep <NOBR>level--</NOBR> that which expands the limitations in our
			minds and inspires us to be better citizens. And this is especially important in this class. Centered around
			debating a certain topic with preparation supplied by the teacher, we are reminded that when we argue, we
			employ <NOBR>emotion--</NOBR> that of the debaters (students) and mediators (teachers). This is something
			not instilled in high school debate courses that this particular course offers an opportunity for.</P>
		<P class="p12 ft1">In our lesson plans, we have presented opinions around an issue while also including some
			archival pieces. After exploring the issue, in our plans we have asked students to share their opinions with
			each other via a debate.</P>
		<P class="p13 ft1">The debate itself is a learning process where we stress respect and understanding. The point
			is to practice building bridges in order to reach a greater solution. In what ways can we learn from each
			other and become better citizens?</P>
		<P class="p14 ft1">With the core of this course established, we have left you with a fill in the blank syllabus.
			If you wish to keep the lessons we have formed, feel free to transfer that information into the lines with
			blue font. If you wish to form your own based upon what we have done, fill those blue lines in with your own
			words.</P>
		<P class="p15 ft1">Take this course as not only a growing experience for your students, but one for you as well,
			dear teacher. Be the bridge your students are vying to become. Allow the students to become teachers in
			their own rights and for you a student. Only then will you meet in the middle, and only then will Social
			Lives in Debate be realized.</P>
		<P class="p16 ft1">Lead in your example and have fun exploring all that our society has to offer! The syllabus
			is as follows:</P>

		<P class="p0 ft0">Statement of Grading Approach</P>
		<P class="p37 ft7">&lt;For example, are major assignments or exams grading on a curve? Will exams be graded
			anonymously? Will a “curve” be applied when grades are tabulated? We intended for the debates to make up the
			majority of the grading and for it not to be the most important worry of the class, although of course
			provide incentive. It is important to stress subjectivity even in the grading response.&gt;</P>
		<P class="p38 ft0">Explanation of Grading System</P>
		<P class="p39 ft7">&lt;Include assignments, exams, presentations, etc. that together determine the final grade
			for the course, with a clear indication of the value of each. This will probably be tailored to the specific

		<P class="p149 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft15">Do you feel there is bias? If so, in what

		</P>
		<P class="p152 ft30"><SPAN class="ft0">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft38">What are your thoughts on the scriptures and

				do some independent thinking about which side they feel more inclined towards. They will pick a side
				they’re leaning towards and try to discover why they feel this way. Is this opinion stemming from what

				change it? They will be asked to argue their side the following week so this reflection period is early
				preparation for that.</SPAN></P>

			(although of course very different). This may reveal how much emotion impacts one’s opinion, especially
			about feminism and autonomy, when one is forced to argue a particular side of an argument. It allows for

			compromising, is worth 3 points. If the argument was changed slightly, then it’s 1 point. If the argument
			was completely overturned, it is worth 0. Both teams must try to win with the impending need to compromise.

				end with no points. The game and their efforts will be made pointless. But, if a compromise is reached
				that aids both teams, then every student will get 5 extra credit points for the grade of the upcoming
				debate. If one team comes out on top, they will each receive 3 extra credit points, but the losing team
				will receive nothing. The class must work together to allow for all students to gain points. But also
