<P class="p0 ft0">From Dummies to Assassins: How Drones Became A Centerpiece of US Foreign Policy</P>
<p>By Rya Jetha and Hannah Jacobs</p>
<P class="p1 ft2">Drone (verb) make a continuous low humming sound</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">Drone (noun) a male bee in a colony of social bees, which does no work but can fertilize a queen</P>
<P class="p3 ft5">Before drones became an indispensable tool of counterterrorism, the word meant two things: insect and sound. The word took on a new meaning during World War II, when American soldiers training to shoot down planes named their dummies “target drones.”<SPAN class="ft4">1 </SPAN>The phrase referred to the low humming sound made by the small planes and the disposable male bee that does not gather nectar or pollen, only lives to fertilize the queen, and is eventually killed off by his fellow bees. The name was apt for the American target drones – expendable dummies, fated to be shot down.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">It would be many decades before drones evolved from serving as practice targets to targeting an enemy. Ancestors of the <NOBR>modern-day</NOBR> drone, such as aerial torpedoes, were used during the World Wars; however, the planes that launched these torpedoes were <NOBR>single-use</NOBR> projectiles while the contemporary drone is a reusable <NOBR>projectile-carrying</NOBR> machine. The real drone revolution came about around the turn of the century. In 1995, American technology and defence company General Atomics invented a <NOBR>remote-controlled</NOBR> spy plane that they called the Predator. It was first deployed in Kosovo during the NATO intervention to collect footage and illuminate targets with lasers. The Predator wasn’t killing targets yet; however, its name foreshadowed what was yet to come.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">After NATO intervened in the Baltics, the U.S. government continued experimenting with drone technology. In fact, in September 2000, during an experimental flight over Kandahar, the epicenter of Taliban power in Afghanistan, one Predator drone unexpectedly found Osama Bin Laden standing in white robes near his compound.<SPAN class="ft4">2 </SPAN>Though Bin Laden was a notorious terrorist leader at the time, known for coordinating twin suicide bombings at the Kenyan and Tanzanian U.S. embassies in 1998, the Predator that found him was not equipped with any weapons, and the U.S. was still undecided about its authority to kill him.<SPAN class="ft4">3 </SPAN>Bin Laden got away, and <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> flew planes into the World Trade Center one year later. Shortly after Bin Laden escaped, the Predator was successfully tested firing an antitank missile. The CIA had transformed the Predator from a</P>

<P class="p9 ft5">spying tool into an assassination device, meaning that it could theoretically <SPAN class="ft2">identify </SPAN>and <SPAN class="ft2">kill </SPAN>terrorist targets, such as Bin Laden.<SPAN class="ft4">4</SPAN></P>
<P class="p10 ft5">After 9/11, the U.S. decided against a <NOBR>full-scale</NOBR> invasion of Afghanistan, choosing instead to pursue Operation Enduring Freedom, which involved the CIA, Special Forces, and the U.S. Air Force. The mission was to cleanse Afghanistan of <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> and their Taliban hosts. The first strike by a drone was conducted in October 2001 against a high profile <NOBR>target—Taliban</NOBR> Supreme Commander Mullah Mohammed Omar.<SPAN class="ft4">5 </SPAN>The strike missed him. Instead, it killed his bodyguards, who were sitting in a car outside his compound. The first drone strike ever conducted sent a resounding message: the aerial assassins were imprecise, unreliable, and not yet ready to partake in a <NOBR>high-stakes</NOBR> invasion 7,000 miles away from the U.S. In fact, five days after the failed attempt at killing the Taliban Commander, a CIA team was almost bombed by an agency drone after the operating team mistook their own employees for <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> operatives.<SPAN class="ft4">6 </SPAN>The CIA, however, was undeterred, seeing massive potential in their unmanned assassins. By December, even President Bush publicly advocated their use, telling his audience at The Military College of South Carolina that a secret CIA weapon was “able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme accuracy.” He proclaimed that “The military does not have enough unmanned vehicles,” thus kicking off a new era of warfare and counterterrorism.<SPAN class="ft4">7</SPAN></P>
<P class="p11 ft5">Over the twenty years that the U.S. has intervened in Afghanistan, drones have evolved from a scarcely tested, <NOBR>little-known</NOBR> device into a central feature of American foreign policy. They offer a transcendence of traditional military limitations during combat and in collecting intelligence, giving actors with drone technology an apparent eye of God over the enemy. Grégoire Chamayou, a political philosopher at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris and author of <SPAN class="ft2">A Theory of the Drone, </SPAN>writes that Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon has been reinvented for warfare through “winged and armed panoptics” that persistently surveille and terrorize the enemy.<SPAN class="ft4">8 </SPAN>Unlike a soldier, the drone is free from the constraints of the human body, assuring governments a “constant <NOBR>geo-spatial</NOBR> ‘overwatch’” by the institutional eye<SPAN class="ft4">9 </SPAN>and a “hunting ground” instead of a battlefield.<SPAN class="ft4">10 </SPAN>Most importantly, drones promise a bloodless conflict for everyone <SPAN class="ft2">but the enemy, </SPAN>making the elusive dream of “project[ing] power without projecting vulnerability” seem ever more attainable.<SPAN class="ft4">11</SPAN></P>

<P class="p17 ft5">In this piece, we seek to understand how the U.S. drone program has become a central feature of U.S. foreign policy by tracing its development through the lens of the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan. The first drone strike took place in Afghanistan in 2001, and now, as U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, Afghanistan continues to command center stage. Before we tackle the implications of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan for drone policy, we will go back in time to trace the evolution of the U.S. drone program in Afghanistan through the Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies. We will explore how each president has approached the drone program, changed policies, and influenced debates around the topic.</P>
<P class="p18 ft17">Nodes, Kingpins, and Mowing the Grass: Counterrorism Strategy Before Drones</P>
<P class="p19 ft5">Presidential candidate George W. Bush was already thinking about drones in 1999. When speaking about his defence program at the Citadel Military school in South Carolina, he said “Our forces in the next century must be agile, lethal, readily deployed…. [Our] military must be</P>
<P class="p20 ft5">able to identify targets by a variety of means, then be able to destroy those targets almost instantly. We must be able to strike from across the world with pinpoint accuracy… with unmanned systems.”<SPAN class="ft4">12 </SPAN>He continued to say that “Power is increasingly defined, not by mass or size, but by mobility and swiftness. Influence is measured in information, safety is gained in stealth, and force is projected on the long arc of <NOBR>precision-guided</NOBR> weapons.”<SPAN class="ft4">13 </SPAN>His words foreshadowed a revolution in military technology that was well underway and a mode of American military thinking that goes back to the Vietnam War. However, unlike General William Westmoreland, who in 1969 predicted that the battlefield would have automated surveillance devices locating, tracking and targeting the enemy,<SPAN class="ft4">14 </SPAN><NOBR>soon-to-be</NOBR> President Bush was standing at the precipice of circumstances and technological advances that even he did not fully understand.</P>
<P class="p21 ft5">Six days after 9/11, President Bush signed a secret “Memorandum of Notification” giving the CIA authority to hunt down <NOBR>high-value</NOBR> targets within <NOBR>al-Qaeda.<SPAN class="ft4">15</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> </SPAN>At the same time, President Bush did not waive the executive order banning assassinations.<SPAN class="ft4">16 </SPAN>Instead, the Bush administration defined <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> operatives as “enemy combatants” in order to place them outside the purview of a legal ban against assassinations that had been crafted by military lawyer W. Hays Parks in 1989.<SPAN class="ft4">17 </SPAN>President Bush even drew himself a pyramid showing enemies of importance, with Bin Laden right at the top.<SPAN class="ft4">18 </SPAN>This pyramid represented a way of thinking about</P>

<P class="p17 ft5">enemies that borrowed from previous theories of foreign and domestic counterterrorism. The “critical node” strategy originated during World War II, when the U.S. Air Force theorized that finding and destroying critical nodes in the war effort, such as railways and oil refineries, would cause a collapse in the enemy war effort and an end to the war.<SPAN class="ft4">19 </SPAN>However, none of the destruction brought about enemy collapse. Collecting intelligence about critical nodes proved difficult, leading to a widening of possible targets. In the end, everything became a possible target, rendering the strategy indiscriminate and ineffective. This same theory was applied decades later to the war in Vietnam, with U.S. generals asserting that destroying the critical node in the war — the route from the North to the South — would bring an end to the war. Once again, identifying critical nodes proved impossible.<SPAN class="ft4">20</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft5">From the inception of the critical node strategy, the target nodes had been <SPAN class="ft2">things, </SPAN>not <SPAN class="ft2">people. </SPAN>This changed in 1991 when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The Pentagon temporarily identified him as the most important node to target in order to collapse the invasion effort until an employee remembered that assassination was banned by the U.S. government.<SPAN class="ft4">21 </SPAN>Although Saddam Hussain’s name did not stay on an assassination list for long, a domestic policy was developing at the same time in the U.S. that classified people as targets. Named the “kingpin strategy” and spearheaded by the Drug Enforcement Administration in the early 1990s, the theory worked off the same assumption as the critical node theory: the U.S. faced a hierarchical threat that could be destroyed by targeting its fundamental components.<SPAN class="ft4">22 </SPAN>The DEA began targeting the “kingpins'' and henchmen of drug cartels in the U.S. and Latin America with the goal of rendering them ineffective by destroying their command and control structures. Although this strategy proved highly ineffective — drug prices actually decreased when kingpins were killed — after 9/11 the strategy was transplanted from the U.S. and Latin America to the Middle East, where it informed President Bush’s pyramid of critical or kingpin targets and was applied to <NOBR>al-Qaeda.</NOBR> Additionally, the close relationship between the U.S. and Israeli governments meant that the Israel intelligence agency’s strategy of “mowing the grass” — continuously killing terrorists in a network until only inexperienced and ineffective actors are left behind — was incorporated into U.S. counterterrorism thinking.<SPAN class="ft4">23 </SPAN>According to the theory, if one “mowed the grass” for long enough using “targeted killings,” the “barrel of terror” would be drained. Just weeks after 9/11, the U.S. used this strategy in its failed attempt to kill critical node Commander Mullah Mohammed Omar, signalling that Afghanistan was now the testing ground of American counterterrorism strategy.</P>
<P class="p27 ft17">From Surveillant to Weapon</P>
<P class="p28 ft5">Under President Bush, the U.S. Air Force and its British Allies learned how to use drones as they flew over Afghanistan. The country was not only a site for implementing counterterrorism</P>

<P class="p17 ft5">theories. It was also a testing ground for new technology. The allies relied on newly introduced technology in the Middle East, including the Thuraya satellite phone, which transmitted location signals to help pilots carry out “targeted killings” (a term borrowed from Israeli intelligence that would soon become synonymous with the drone war). From 2001 to 2007, the CIA conducted few strikes, working through various technological challenges and choosing more reliable forms of technology to carry out airstrikes in lieu of drones.<SPAN class="ft4">24 </SPAN>Throughout these years, the U.S. government rules surrounding targeted killings were strict, meaning that the CIA had to overcome significant hurdles before it was authorized to strike a target. In 2008, however, Michael Hayden, then CIA director and a former head of the NSA, petitioned to loosen these rules. He made his case directly to President Bush, outlining how <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> was building power and networks along the lawless northern frontier of Pakistan. President Bush was easily convinced that the CIA should be given more discretion to carry out drone strikes. He gave them permission to attack targets after giving only limited notice to the Pakistani government, and he went even further, giving the CIA permission to strike targets that had not been previously identified. Rather than require drone operators to know who they planned to assassinate, they could carry out “signature attacks,” which allowed them to shoot down entire vehicles that acted suspiciously, as if they were combatants.<SPAN class="ft4">25 </SPAN>People could henceforth be killed based on their behavior or “pattern of life,”<SPAN class="ft4">26 </SPAN>and any male who had finished <NOBR>grade-school</NOBR> could be considered a “presumed combatant.”<SPAN class="ft4">27 </SPAN>People’s identities no longer mattered so long as they <SPAN class="ft2">seemed </SPAN>to act like terrorists. These changes made it easier to confuse a van carrying targets with a van carrying innocent people, or a group of men exercising with an <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> training camp. The number of drone strikes skyrocketed, civilian death tolls appeared to plummet, and drone strikes received less negative press. These shifts in thinking about drone targets would have profound impacts on U.S. drone policy as President Barack Obama entered office in 2009, pledging to end the ‘forever wars’ in the Middle East.</P>

<P class="p24 ft5">effort to appease voters who had become disillusioned with the “forever wars.” During a speech he gave in 2007, titled “The War We Need to Win',' Obama suggested that he would continue <NOBR>“mow-the-grass”</NOBR> counterterrorism strategies institutionalized by the Bush administration. “If we have actionable intelligence about <NOBR>high-value</NOBR> terrorist targets and President Musharraf won’t act, we will,” he said.<SPAN class="ft4">29 </SPAN>In the first term of his administration, there were about 300 drone strikes in Pakistan alone, roughly a sixfold increase from the number during the entire Bush administration.<SPAN class="ft4">30 </SPAN>This increase demonstrated that the Obama administration saw drones as a convenient way to distance itself from unpopular wars while still maintaining the “fictional eye of God.”<SPAN class="ft4">31 </SPAN>According to foreign policy expert David Sanger, Obama was able to keep boots off the ground and insulate the American public from the ongoing wars in the Middle East by waging a war on terror “in the shadows, using drone strikes, special operations and sophisticated surveillance.”<SPAN class="ft4">32 </SPAN>He justified the covert way of fighting terrorism by arguing that it was “efficient, and even morally necessary, given the state of the U.S. economy and the <NOBR>war-weariness</NOBR> of the American people.”<SPAN class="ft4">33 </SPAN>David Kilcullen, a counterterrorism expert, writes that keeping boots off the ground while delivering tactical victories made “the drones as addictive as catnip.”<SPAN class="ft4">34 </SPAN>Just as the critical node strategy had started off with a shortlist of <NOBR>high-value</NOBR> targets but evolved into a lengthy and indiscriminate one, targets pursued by the Obama administration evolved from <NOBR>high-value</NOBR> senior <NOBR>al-Qaeda</NOBR> or Taliban leaders into a long list of <NOBR>lower-ranking</NOBR> members and associated terrorist <NOBR>groups–once</NOBR> again, because of difficulties with collecting reliable intelligence.<SPAN class="ft4">35 </SPAN>In 2010, one militant told <SPAN class="ft2">New York Times </SPAN>reporters that “it seems they really want to kill everyone, not just the leaders.”<SPAN class="ft4">36</SPAN></P>
<P class="p37 ft5">At the start of Obama’s presidency, drones were “swathed in secrecy, meaning, among other things, that it was still possible to hide mistakes.”<SPAN class="ft4">37 </SPAN>However, a few years into the presidency, they could no longer hide. Following the most intense year of strikes yet in 2010 and the May 2011 raid of Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, the Pakistani government evicted the American drone fleet from the Shamsi Air Base in Balochistan.<SPAN class="ft4">38 </SPAN>At this time, Cameron Munter,</P>

<P class="p44 ft5">the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, began pushing the U.S. government for better drone oversight and coordination with local governments.<SPAN class="ft4">39 </SPAN>Even as casualties rose in Yemen and Pakistan, officials had refused to discuss drone strikes until pressure from Congress and the State Department, along with media reports about Obama’s “shadow war,” led the Obama administration to publicly discuss the drone program for the first time in 2012. At the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C., John Brennan, who served as the United States Homeland Security Advisor under Obama from 2009 to 2013 and later as the Director of the CIA from 2013 to 2017, formally acknowledged the existence of armed drones, stressing that they were precise, humanitarian devices that decreased both American vulnerability and collateral damage in combat zones. Brennan said that drones carry out attacks with <SPAN class="ft20">“surgical precision” and that their “ability, with </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft20">laser-like</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft20"> focus, to eliminate the cancerous tumor called an </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft20">al-Qaeda</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft20"> terrorist while limiting damage to the tissue around it… makes this counterterrorism tool so essential.”</SPAN><SPAN class="ft21">40 </SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">Later in the speec</SPAN>h, Brennan cited the case made by administration lawyers over the past year that the drone program was consistent with international and U.S. law, although he did not provide details on how names are added to the military or CIA kill lists.<SPAN class="ft4">41</SPAN></P>
<P class="p45 ft5">Despite this statement, many questioned the legality of drones, including the President himself. In a speech at the University of Chicago in 2016, Obama conceded that the drone program had little legal standing. Title 50 authority provided leeway for the CIA to conduct drone strikes while keeping them secret.<SPAN class="ft4">42 </SPAN>An action declared under Title 50 is classified as covert and is described as “an activity or activities of the United States Government to influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.”<SPAN class="ft4">43 </SPAN>Essentially, Title 50 allows little disclosure of drone strikes, removing requirements for transparency and accountability. To at least partially remove the shroud of secrecy around drones and encourage more public debate about drone use, Obama tried to bring the program to light by giving the U.S. Air Force more control over the drone program instead of the CIA.<SPAN class="ft4">44</SPAN></P>
<P class="p46 ft5">Some critics claimed that the CIA had too much power to decide the drone’s fate and faced little legislative oversight. To reassert the White House’s power and limit the CIA’s covert operations, President Obama personally oversaw the “kill list” and approved the targets of future drone assassinations.<SPAN class="ft4">45 </SPAN>Furthermore, Obama tried to solidify the program’s legality by establishing guidelines that required drone strikes to use a proportionate amount of force for a given situation,</P>

<P class="p44 ft5">limit civilian casualties, and create fewer enemies than the number that they eliminated.<SPAN class="ft4">46 </SPAN>Some of Obama’s guidelines require a <NOBR>near-certain</NOBR> identification of individuals before a strike and evidence that the threat posed by a target be deemed “continuing and imminent.”<SPAN class="ft4">47 </SPAN><NOBR>Obama-era</NOBR> checks and balances, however, did not outlive his presidency. Donald Trump had other ideas for American counteterrrorism and surveillance.</P>
<P class="p51 ft17">The Quagmire Continues</P>
<P class="p52 ft5">Before Donald Trump assumed the Presidency in 2017, he was adamant about his views when it came to the forever wars: he wanted them to end. During his campaign, he insisted that the U.S. would stay out of these conflicts, but like his predecessors, he too fell into the “quagmire of war.”<SPAN class="ft4">48 </SPAN>By the summer of 2017, Trump had already increased the number of troops in the Middle East, including Afghanistan, by a total of 33%.<SPAN class="ft4">49 </SPAN>Trump authorized more ground troops, an additional 4,000 to the existing 11,000.<SPAN class="ft4">50 </SPAN>Accompanying these additional boots on the ground, the U.S. military also “dropped twice as many bombs on the Taliban and the newly formed branch of ISIS in Afghanistan than it did in all of 2016.”<SPAN class="ft4">51 </SPAN>According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Trump oversaw 2,243 drone strikes in the first two years of his presidency, while Obama authorized 1,878 during his eight years in office.”<SPAN class="ft4">52 </SPAN>Trump escalated the war in Afghanistan, even though he said that he had planned to completely withdraw American troops.</P>
<P class="p53 ft5">This drone escalation was possible in part because President Trump eased restrictions that the Obama administration had applied to the drone program. Journalist Umar A. Farooq writes: “In Trump's first year of office, his administration eased two restrictions for drone strikes: removing the limitation that only allowed strikes on <NOBR>high-ranking</NOBR> militants and removing the previous vetting process for drone strikes. The U.S. also relaxed a restriction on its rules of engagement so that it no longer had to be in direct contact with enemy forces to conduct airstrikes.”<SPAN class="ft4">53 </SPAN>Essentially, Trump relaxed the process for identifying whether someone posed a threat to the U.S. Rather than requiring that a terrorist target pose a “continuing and imminent threat,” as was the requirement established by the Obama administration, <NOBR>lower-level</NOBR> enemies, such as foot soldiers, could be targeted by drones. While the Obama administration did ultimately target</P>

<P class="p24 ft5"><NOBR>lower-level</NOBR> enemies, the Trump administration officially removed the Obama administration’s formal, though toothless, restriction. Under Trump’s drone program, the U.S. can also use drones in countries outside the theatres of war — any and all terrorist organizations can be a target, regardless of whether they are in a combat zone.<SPAN class="ft4">54 </SPAN>Many commentators have said that <NOBR>Trump-era</NOBR> policies were simply a continuation of Bush and Obama era practices. For example, despite Trump’s relaxation of rules regarding strikes outside war zones, he conducted fewer strikes outside warzones than Obama. Trump’s policies merely solidified policy that had been practised for years, formalizing drones within a global combat zone, unhindered by borders, laws, and accountability.</P>
<P class="p59 ft17">The Future of Drone Policy</P>
<P class="p60 ft5">Counterterrorism drone warfare reached its fourth American president when Joe Biden was sworn in this year. However, how Biden will influence U.S. drone policy is uncertain. In March 2021, the <SPAN class="ft2">New York Times </SPAN>reported that Biden had begun reviewing the legal and policy frameworks that regulate drone targetings. “This review includes an examination of previous approaches in the context of evolving counterterrorism threats in order to refine our approach going forward,” Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council said. “In addition, the review will seek to ensure appropriate transparency measures.”<SPAN class="ft4">55 </SPAN>Reports also state that the Biden administration is having conversations about whether to return to the <NOBR>Obama-era</NOBR> approach, which had more centralized oversight and higher levels of intelligence collection, or to continue with <NOBR>Trump-era</NOBR> policies, which were decentralized with fewer accountability measures.<SPAN class="ft4">56 </SPAN>It should be noted that Biden’s Director of National Intelligence is Avril Haines, who served as <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_National_Security_Advisor">Deputy National Security Advisor </A>and <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency">Deputy Director of the </A>CIA in the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama">Obama administration. </A>Haines is regarded as a key architect of Obama’s drone program expansion, and a <A href="https://www.newsweek.com/2013/06/26/avril-haines-least-likely-spy-237616.html">2013 Newsweek profile of </A>her claims that she “was sometimes summoned in the middle of the night to weigh in on whether a suspected terrorist could be lawfully incinerated by a drone strike.”<SPAN class="ft4">57 </SPAN>Whether Haines’ role in the new administration will have any bearing on the direction of Biden’s drone policy is yet to be seen, especially in the face of growing public pressure to end the drone wars. On June 30, 2021, 113 organizations from the United States and around the world petitioned President Biden to end lethal strikes, including drone strikes, outside of declared battlefields. “We appreciate your stated commitments to ending ‘forever wars,’ promoting racial justice, and centering human rights in U.S. foreign policy,” they said, adding</P>

<P class="p64 ft5">While the Biden administration conducts their review and public admonition continues, the spotlight has shifted to the crumbling of the Afghan government and Taliban resurgence. Biden himself alluded to the future of the U.S. drone program in Afghanistan at a White House briefing on July 8th, when he announced that the U.S. is “developing a counterterrorism <NOBR>over-the-horizon</NOBR> capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region [Afghanistan], and act quickly and decisively if needed.”<SPAN class="ft4">59 </SPAN>CNN reported on July 3rd that <SPAN class="ft23">the U.S. military will retain authority to carry out strikes against the Taliban in support of Afghan forces.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft24">60 </SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">Conversations in the Biden administration at the moment are focused on giving immediate humanitarian assistance to Afghans by keeping the airport open in Kabul, and not on a </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft23">long-term</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft23"> counterterrorism strategy that could involve drones.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft24">61 </SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">Whether the Biden administration adopts drone strategies in the long term that rely on the critical node theory, kingpin strategy, or </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft23">mow-the-grass</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft23"> approach, or if drone policy departs from historically accepted ideas about counterterrorism is uncertain. What is clear in the present is that Afghanistan’s fall to the Taliban is a major turning point for U.S. foreign policy and will likely dictate key components of the Biden drone policy going forward.</SPAN></P>
