    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>By providing a space for thoughtful engagement across political divides, we seek to nurture a political discourse
      where peace, understood as the capacity to navigate disagreements through goodwill dialogue, can become a regular
      practice.</p>
    <h2>About Our Work</h2>
    <p>The Panorama Project is a group of individuals with a shared concern about the entrenched political divisions in
      American politics. Funded by <a href="https://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/">Davis Projects for Peace</a>, our program offers open-minded students from across the U.S. an opportunity to understand experiences and opinions that differ from their own. Working in teams of 2-4, participants co-authored works of journalism that focus on an issue in U.S. politics. In their work, participants draw from diverse sources, including interviews, academic sources, news articles, works of art, historical resources, and their own experiences. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While working on these collaborative projects, participants gathered for a series of 
      workshops hosted by partners from the Aspen Institute's Better Arguments project, Carleton College, Middle Ground School Solutions, and Politico. 
      These workshops enriched the research and writing process by focusing on media bias, the challenges and benefits of co-authoring work, writing for public audiences, 
      and how to have productive disagreements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Panorama Project took place remotely during the summer of 2021. Participants created 20 projects as part of the program.
