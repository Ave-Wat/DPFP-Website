            <P class="p0 ft0">From Culture War to Conversation: Taking a Complex Approach to Safe Spaces and Trigger
                Warnings on College Campuses</P>
            <P class="p1 ft1">Jonah Henkle and Lauren Hagemeister</P>
            <P class="p2 ft3">In recent years calls for the practice of trigger warnings and implementation of safe
                spaces on college campuses has generated a debate around these practices’ efficacy, importance and the
                potential for stifling freedom of expression and intellectual integrity. Safe spaces and trigger
                warnings have arisen on college campuses as students demand some forms of protection from unsavory, and
                in their view, potentially harmful language and concepts. The trigger warning, derived from the
                discourse surrounding PTSD, is meant to alert students to material that may cause a recurrence of trauma
                and provide them an opportunity to excuse themselves before exposure. Safe <NOBR>spaces--zones</NOBR> in
                which students can expect an environment free of severe offense or other emotional <NOBR><SPAN
                        class="ft2">harm</SPAN>--ensure</NOBR> that triggering content must contain a warning if at all
                present. Critics argue imposing such measures liberally, quickly devolves into a situation in which
                minor offences, or the mere anticipation of them, shuts down the free exchange of ideas and alienates
                unpopular viewpoints. Supporters claim safe spaces and trigger warnings are modest protections for
                vulnerable students, necessary for fostering an inclusive and welcoming setting.</P>
            <P class="p3 ft5">This culture war issue of trigger warnings and safe spaces on college campuses took off as
                conservative pundits began to highlight significantly extreme abuses of these practices across the
                country. Trigger warnings have especially garnered disproportionate attention in the greater
                conservative pushback against contemporary political correctness. A notable case covered widely in the
                <NOBR>news-media</NOBR> was the 2015 <SPAN class="ft4">pro safe space </SPAN>
                <NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">op-ed</SPAN></NOBR> published in Columbia University’s student newspaper
                denouncing the concentrated teaching of the Western canon on the grounds that “it contains triggering
                and offensive material that marginalizes student identities in the classroom. These texts, wrought with
                histories and narratives of exclusion and oppression, can be difficult to read and discuss as a
                survivor, a person of color, or a student from a <NOBR>low-income</NOBR> background.” In 2014 Oberlin
                College also made national headlines for issuing a controversial policy requiring professors to include
                trigger warnings in course syllabuses for any content that “disrupt[s] a student’s learning and may make
                some students feel unsafe in your classroom,” including; racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism,
                cissexism, ableism, and

            <P class="p4 ft3">other issues of privilege and oppression. As reported by <SPAN class="ft6">Inside Higher
                    Ed</SPAN>, the policy issued in the school’s Sexual Offense Resource Guide defined triggering
                content as material that which “recalls a traumatic event to an individual,” and advised faculty to
                include trigger warnings when necessary and “remove triggering material when it does not contribute
                directly to the course learning goals.”</P>
            <P class="p5 ft3">Critics worried that codifying what does and does not belong in the classroom based on
                emotional discomfort removes integrity from institutions of higher education and inhibits the students
                who may be benefitted from said material’s inclusion. Just months following it’s instruction, the policy
                was removed from Resource Guide and placed under revision. No similar policy has been enacted since.</P>
            <P class="p6 ft5">These examples, and others were brought to the forefront of the national debate following
                Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff’s viral 2015 <SPAN class="ft4">article</SPAN> in <SPAN class="ft7">The
                    Atlantic</SPAN>, titled “The Coddling of the American Mind,” which makes a comprehensive case
                against the implementation of trigger warnings and safe spaces on college campuses, arguing they are not
                only <NOBR>“anti-intellectual,”</NOBR> but that “the expansive use of trigger warnings may also foster
                unhealthy mental habits.”</P>
            <P class="p7 ft10">Proponents of safe spaces and trigger warnings, often reject the notion that these
                practices limit freedom of speech. Rather they do a necessary service: maintaining a learning and living
                environment for students that does not threaten their emotional safety. In 2016, the University of
                Chicago published <SPAN class="ft8">a letter</SPAN> openly denouncing safe spaces and trigger warnings
                for their <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> infringements on intellectual freedoms. In response, Cameron Okeke, a
                UChicago graduate wrote in <SPAN class="ft8">a piece for </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">Vox</SPAN>; “to those
                unfamiliar with the UChicago’s abysmal campus climate, a strong stance against echo chambers may seem
                reasonable. But marginalized students know that this declaration ignores the real problems on campus:
                sexual assault, racial profiling, and other troubling issues.” While these pro safe spacers raise
                reasonable concerns about underdressed harassment and discrimination on campus, the question is: are
                safe spaces and trigger warnings an appropriate response?</P>
            <P class="p8 ft3">In order to compensate for the overt adversities students will experience in their
                academic careers, critics further tout the concept that avoiding triggering content is an improper
                coping mechanism for individuals suffering from PTSD. Both the more moderate perspectives of the <NOBR>
                    anti-trigger</NOBR> warning movement, such as that written by Luikenhoff and</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_3">


            <P class="p9 ft5">Haidt, and <NOBR>far-right</NOBR> publications like the <SPAN class="ft7">National Review
                </SPAN>use this assertion when confronted with the overwhelming number of students suffering from PTSD
                and their wants of protection from troubling content. An <SPAN class="ft4">article</SPAN> published by
                the <SPAN class="ft7">National Review </SPAN>in July 2019 references a study conducted by Harvard
                psychologists which found that trigger warnings create anticipatory anxiety rather than allow
                individuals to prepare for troubling content. The study concluded that “trigger warnings
                countertherapeutically reinforce survivors’ view of their trauma as central to their identity.” Where
                Luikenhoff and Haidt successfully make a more compelling case on this front is in their contention that
                cognitive behavioral therapy acts as a more healthy expression of “mental hygiene” than avoidance
                through trigger warnings. Both the <NOBR>study-based</NOBR> and <NOBR>psychology-based</NOBR>
                contentions are wrought with conflicting evidence and do little to assuage the concerns of those who are
                truly affected by the outcome of the debate.</P>
            <P class="p10 ft11">A Battle of Strawmen</P>
            <P class="p11 ft5">Due to the unresolved nature of the definition for the term “safe space” and its
                emotional weight, this debate tends to be unwieldy with each opposing side appearing to be talking about
                different things. The two sides engage in what one ought to call a battle of strawmen; each side takes
                on the project of selectively attacking positions adjacent to reality while effectively <NOBR>
                    side-stepping</NOBR> from some of the more difficult aspects of the conflict. For those against safe
                spaces and trigger warnings, it is easy to rail against restrictive regimes of speech codes and
                censorship that causes students to constantly walk on eggshells, which is why many of their arguments
                center around this dystopian description of college campuses in the age of <NOBR>so-called</NOBR>
                “safetyism.” Conversely, those defending safe spaces minimize the scope of student demands to avoid the
                burdensome outcomes these practices have occasionally produced.</P>
            <P class="p12 ft3">In an <SPAN class="ft6">Intelligence Squared debate</SPAN> on the topic, Micheal Roth,
                President of Wesleyan University and safe space advocate, did this exactly, saying, “clearly there are
                strong feelings on both sides of this issue and the issue can be distorted so that it's easier to take a
                stand. So, no one is really arguing that all students all the time should be protected against any
                disagreeable idea. Nobody has ever argued that. That's just never happened.” In a literal sense, he’s
                certainly correct; generally, some disagreeable ideas are</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_4">


            <P class="p13 ft5">tolerated in safe spaces. However, the kinds of safe spaces some students are demanding
                often do require protection from conflict deemed normative just a few years ago, and the extent of these
                safe spaces can encompass an entire campus. Roth and others purport safe spaces to be simply freedom of
                association: students have the right to form spaces where they are free from being bombarded with
                unwanted speech. Although students are not asking merely for safe spaces as special specified zones on
                campus. Increasingly, there is an expectation that campus as a whole is safe. Alternatively, the picture
                of <NOBR>all-out</NOBR> censorship <NOBR>campus-wide</NOBR> as painted by those opposing safe spaces is
                wildly out of touch.</P>
            <P class="p14 ft5">Much of the momentum behind this debate is driven by perceptions of emotion and identity.
                Though we argue this is not simply a <NOBR>left-right</NOBR> conflict, campus culture wars expose an
                increasing sense of alienation among conservatives, especially on the campuses that embrace safe spaces
                and trigger warnings the most. It appears that many of the free speech arguments are tied to a sense
                that certain <NOBR>viewpoints--primarily</NOBR> those held by the right wing minority on college <NOBR>
                    campuses--are</NOBR> being silenced. Safe space supporters <NOBR>write-off</NOBR> these unspeakable
                positions as intolerance that, in turn, mustn't be tolerated.</P>
            <P class="p15 ft5">Advocates of safe spaces and trigger warnings situate these practices as needed <NOBR>
                    safe-gaurds</NOBR> against the oppression and trauma suffered by marginalized groups. There is a
                sentiment expressed in the aforementioned Columbia <NOBR>Op-Ed,</NOBR> Okeke’s <SPAN class="ft7">Vox
                </SPAN>article, and throughout much of the safe space discourse, that one’s position on this issue is
                indicative of how much they care about marginalized groups and equity. The application of these
                arguments vastly raise the temperature of the debate. Though these positions are valid, we fear adding a
                moral dimension to this conflict obscures the discourse and detracts from reasonable concerns on both
                sides.</P>
            <P class="p16 ft5">Throughout our research we kept finding the same phrase appearing in some form or other:
                “feel silenced.” Whether referring to the attitudes of students living under the imposition of <NOBR>
                    so-called</NOBR> speech codes, real, or imagined, or in descriptions of “unsafe” classroom
                environments for students belonging to marginalized groups, the specter of feeling silenced is pervasive
                on both sides. We think it is important to be critical when assessing the environment on college
                campuses; are safe spaces really censoring students, or is it merely uncomfortable to voice unpopular
                opinions? And are sensitive class discussions around disturbing concepts threatening to the core of
                one’s identity to the point that they are unable to speak, or does the discomfort brought on by these
                topics make speaking difficult? We do not claim to have the answers, but stress that we consider</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_5">


            <P class="p17 ft1">these questions carefully.</P>
            <P class="p18 ft5">There’s little reason to believe people have a genuine disapproval of freedom of
                association, in other words, safe spaces as designated exceptions to otherwise open discourse.
                Additionally, few are legitimately in favor of an <NOBR>all-encompassing</NOBR> rule of complete
                censorship of any idea with the capacity to offend. It would be helpful to center the debate around
                arguably the most important space on a college campus: the classroom. Does the new standard of emotional
                wellness bear a threat to the intellectual traditions of the college classroom? Should the classroom be
                a safe space? These are the questions generative of a substantive debate about the material application
                of safe spaces and trigger warnings where they matter most.</P>
            <P class="p19 ft12">Inside the Classroom</P>
            <P class="p20 ft5">I, Lauren, have developed my judgement of safe spaces and trigger warnings primarily
                through what I have experienced and seen accomplished at the University of Richmond where I have been a
                student for the past three years. In 2019, the school finished constructing its first <SPAN
                    class="ft4">Multicultural Center</SPAN> with the purpose of “<SPAN class="ft13">having a defined
                    place where students of color are able to foster and develop a stronger sense of community.” This
                    action and similar have come largely in response to Richmond’s maintained ranking of </SPAN><SPAN
                    class="ft4">10th on Little Race/Class Interaction</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13"> as purported by the
                    Princeton Review. I view my campus as the reason we cannot fully dismiss safe spaces and trigger
                    warnings based on cherry picked cases of extreme abandonment of free speech as there are students
                    who perceive a lack of belonging and safety without them.</SPAN></P>
            <P class="p21 ft5">Along with creating a more welcoming environment for its students, the University of
                Richmond also established the Task Force on Freedom of Expression following a “red light” rating given
                by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).</P>
            <P class="p22 ft3">According to Alec Greven, the Richmond student who initialized the campus’s discussions
                “to encourage the university to develop an official statement or policy regarding freedom of speech on
                campus,” “[t]his ranking means that the university had clearly and substantially limited freedom of
                expression.”</P>

                offensive.”</P>
            <P class="p24 ft3">In 2019 amidst the production of the statement, a public discussion between Richmond
                sociology professor Dr. Eric Allen Grollman and student Meghna Melkote partook with each individual
                submitting opinion pieces to the school newspaper <SPAN class="ft14">The Collegian</SPAN>. Their
                conflicting opinion pieces demonstrate the massive misinformation that is purported within this culture
                war.</P>
            <P class="p25 ft1">Dr. Grollman first voiced their concern that <SPAN class="ft15">“UR's free speech push
                    undermines diversity</SPAN></P>
            <P class="p26 ft5"><SPAN class="ft4">and equity.”</SPAN> They condemn the proposed policy’s initiative to
                disallow speakers from visiting the UR campus based incongruence with students’ views. And in making
                this argument, they specifically mention the demographics of the series of cisgendered, White men
                invited to discuss freedom of expression, including Johnathan Haidt <NOBR>co-author</NOBR> of the
                aforementioned Atlantic article. Dr. Grollman specifically states that conservative pundits should not
                be allowed to “infiltrate the seemingly liberal system of higher education,” but lacks regard for the
                diversity of political views held by Richmond students. They are especially critical of former
                university president Ronald Crutcher for his continued advocation of inclusivity in regards to free
                speech and nearing approach to the <SPAN class="ft4">Chicago Principles</SPAN> which include, as stated
                by Grollman, “1) barring the use of trigger warnings, 2) condemning any attempts to block an invited
                speaker's speech (no matter how offensive or inaccurate) and 3) banning the creation of campus safe
                spaces.”</P>
            <P class="p27 ft5">Richmond student Meghna Melkote wrote <SPAN class="ft4">a response</SPAN> to Dr.
                Grollman’s <NOBR>Op-Ed,</NOBR> also published by <SPAN class="ft7">The Collegian. </SPAN>She directly
                counters Grollman’s claims calling the piece “misleading and inaccurate, and fosters a medley of logical
                fallacies.” As demonstrated by Melkote through a thorough evaluation, the initial opinion piece
                massively misrepresented the Chicago Principles but also fostered an invalid argument that free
                expression and inclusivity are mutually exclusive. What is exemplified in this conflict is the
                exaggeration of what problems may occur as a result of a codified policy towards free expression. In
                truth, the statement does little but assuage the concerns that speech will be limited and bears no
                guidance towards what occurs in the classroom. Dr. Grollman’s contention that such policy barrs trigger
                warnings and bans safe spaces has</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_7">


            <P class="p17 ft1">been largely unseen on the University of Richmond campus since its implementation.</P>
            <P class="p28 ft5">I see the concurrent <NOBR>de-stigmatization</NOBR> of safe spaces and construction of a
                policy on free expression as a positive movement. It allows for both sides of a heavily biased culture
                war to see their wants and needs being met. The statement on freedom of expression disavows the
                consersative concern that speech will be limited inside the classroom in terms of emotional security
                while maintaining the academic integrity of the institution by codifying the need for robust dialogue.
                However, I again hold this view because I am a student at the University of Richmond where we are only
                now seeing the very base demands of safe space proponents being met. The debate has not yet reached the
                threshold of the classroom like that of the occurrences at Oberlin College and even Macalester College
                as Jonah has witnessed. I respect and acknowledge that despite reviewing this discourse, my views are
                limited as a college student of just three years.</P>
            <P class="p29 ft5">In my evaluation, as a Macalester student, Macalester’s campus culture differs from
                Richmond’s significantly. The kind of debate between Dr. Grollman and Ms. Melkote simply does not happen
                at Macalester; despite differences in opinion, there appears a tacit assumption that everyone is <NOBR>
                    on-board</NOBR> with a widespread use of trigger warning and safe space practices. Though not all
                professors choose to use them as liberally as some students may prefer, we lack the pro free speech
                pushback. Similarly, I could not find any statements openly advocating for these practices on campus
                either. Without speculation, it is hard to accurately gauge the state of attitudes towards trigger
                warnings and safe spaces at Macalester beyond misinterpretable subtleties.</P>
            <P class="p30 ft5">To broaden our understanding of the climate around trigger warnings and safe spaces at
                Macalester we decided to speak with Dr. Rivi <NOBR>Handler-Spitz,</NOBR> Chair of the Asian Languages
                and Cultures Department at Macalester. <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR> published a <SPAN class="ft4">graphic
                    narrative</SPAN> in <SPAN class="ft7">Inside Higher Education </SPAN>depicting a conflict she had
                with a student regarding trigger warnings and her complex feelings on the topic. As a professor, Dr.
                <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR> has a different, and perhaps more complex view of trigger warnings and safe
                space practices, given students can often demand such measures, but professors are often left with the
                burden of implementing them in the classroom.</P>
            <P class="p31 ft3">To begin discussing these issues, Dr. <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR> made note of the
                linguistic challenges we have addressed in this piece. Far too often, it is painfully unclear what the
                parameters of a safe space is, or what a trigger warning implies, leading to confusion and</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_8">


            <P class="p32 ft3">bad faith arguments from both sides. She claimed the mere terms “trigger warning” and
                “safe space” make inappropriate references to physical violence. She defined the differences between
                trigger warnings, which she sometimes uses, and <NOBR>so-called</NOBR>
                <NOBR>opt-out</NOBR> assignments, which she deems problematic.
            </P>
            <P class="p33 ft10">A trigger warning, she said, “is something like a road sign. When you're on the highway,
                you can't get off if there isn't an exit. [The road sign] is just informing you that as you continue to
                drive along this road there are going to be bumps and you're going to have to face them; that is a
                trigger warning. It's different from an opt out assignment which means, if you can't handle the bumps,
                take exit three and get off and take a local road.”</P>
            <P class="p34 ft5">In her experience with students, this difference is not always understood. Whether, “the
                student thought I was giving them permission to skip pages.” For instance, she has had to tell them, “on
                pages 57 through 59, there's going to be a rape scene, so be aware when you when you read those pages,
                and if you don't read them what I don't want to know, I'm not giving you an alternative. Students are
                always free to not do the homework, they are always free to pretend that they read things that they
                haven't read. So, I'm not telling you don't read those pages and I'm not giving you permission to not
                read those pages. But if you want to know, because I know that sexual violence is an issue for you,
                because you've told me this. I'm happy to tell you.”</P>
            <P class="p35 ft5">Professor <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR> extended a preference to allow students experiencing
                emotional discomfort to develop their own methods to engage with the material to concurrently maintain
                the integrity of the course while allowing the student to retain their agency. “We're using this
                rhetoric, which actually dehumanizes students, turns them into an object.” She claimed, “I want to live
                in a world where students have agency and the professors don't have all the agency.”</P>
            <P class="p36 ft5">Students at Macalester have grown to expect trigger warnings and safe spaces. Professor
                <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR> showed this dynamic in a scene of her graphic narrative, in which one student
                said to another, “how insensitive! I can’t believe she didn’t give you a trigger warning. You need to
                protect yourself. Have her give you an alternative assignment.” Trigger warnings and <NOBR>opt-out
                </NOBR> assignments are so commonplace at Macalester, a sense of entitlement has grown among some
                students, who express outrage without their presence on a syllabus. Professor <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR>
                noted, “students seem reluctant to</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_9">


            <P class="p37 ft10">engage with disturbing material, and <NOBR>well-meaning</NOBR> professors too often
                cater to their preferences, shielding them from what they'd rather not confront.”</P>
            <P class="p38 ft5">Professor <NOBR>Handler-Spitz</NOBR> was able to provide insight into the mechanisms that
                perpetuate these practices on campus. “One way in which students exert pressure on faculty is through
                those end of semester course evaluations,” she said. “Because when a faculty member comes up for review.
                If the students think that this faculty is, you know, a bigoted racist, [etc.] then, that person's
                contract might not be renewed and the person may be out of a job.” If students perceive unfairness, or
                an <SPAN class="ft7">unsafe environment</SPAN>, merited, or not, a professor may be subject to a <NOBR>
                    job-threatening</NOBR> review, incentivising professors to bend to the will of student demands.</P>
            <P class="p39 ft5">Before speaking to Professor <NOBR>Handler-Spitz,</NOBR> we were under the impression
                that students were the driving force behind trigger warnings and safe spaces, however she said: “It
                comes in part from students, but I will dare to say that it also comes from administrators, and it also
                comes from peers within the faculty, I think it's more than simply, I mean, faculty or I think I want to
                say faculty you're pretty good at saying no to students because faculty or older. But when it comes from
                an employer one. It's more culturally pervasive, I think, and certainly when it comes from
                administration. It's harder for faculty to push back against; I think there is a lot of <NOBR>
                    self-censorship</NOBR> at Macalester.” This sense of <NOBR>self-censorship,</NOBR> Professor <NOBR>
                    Handler-Spitz</NOBR> described is something many members of the Macalester community are likely to
                acknowledge, if personally engaged with, likely explains the absence of a dialogue about trigger
                warnings and safe spaces on campus. She described conversations she’s had with students and faculty
                “about moments where they had refused to, or not refused to, but they had refrain from saying things
                that they felt that we're not kind of 100% in line with the lefty, woke kind of party line. And the
                thing about this is, that it's not articulated; nobody tells you you have to do these things, it's just
                kind of a feeling.” That unspoken, “feeling,” is behind this lack of debate on many issues, including
                trigger warnings and safe spaces. Outwardly, the Macalester position on this issue is a monolith,
                however I have come to believe there is a diversity of opinions among students and faculty.</P>
            <P class="p40 ft3">To expand our understanding of University of Richmond’s campus climate and the role of
                administrators in implementing and limiting safe spaces, we spoke to former President of University of
                Richmond, Dr. Ronald Crutcher. Dr. Crutcher, served as faculty at several universities throughout his
                <NOBR>multi-decade</NOBR> career, and has been vocal about these</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_10">


            <P class="p41 ft10">issues at University of Richmond, playing a leading role in the creation of UR’s Free
                Speech Policy.</P>
            <P class="p42 ft5">Many safe space advocates root the need for these practices in the need for protecting
                marginalized groups on campus and in the classroom. From the beginning of our conversation, Dr. Crutcher
                stressed he, “thinks it's true that for certain students: students of color, low income students, who
                might be going into a university like the University of Richmond, where the student body is is upper
                middle class, it is important to provide support for those students as a transition into the community.”
                However, Dr. Crutcher rejects safe spaces and trigger warnings as a universal means to do so.</P>
            <P class="p43 ft10">He characterized some of the difficulties of having a diverse community in this
                environment as “a cognitive dissonance there that occurs. And so you have to be realistic about that and
                help students work through it, but to simply say, ‘Oh, you know, we're going to treat you like a
                hothouse plant and ensure that you don't have to hear from speaker x or speaker y,’ that is totally
                antithetical to the academic enterprise in my estimation.”</P>
            <P class="p44 ft5">Dr. Crutcher framed the current debate around safe spaces and trigger warnings, with
                marginalized groups in mind, in the context of the social movement he was a part of as a young person.
                “During the Civil Rights Movement the notion of a safe space or trigger warning was just that, we were
                taught to push against the stereotype that Black people were weak and not very intelligent and you know
                needed to be protected, etc. So we fought against that and it's really difficult for me to understand
                how, particularly in an academic institution where the whole notion of inquiry learning is around
                questions and questioning assumptions and pushing the boundaries. And so if you're going to say that
                certain topics are off base, then to me that limits the mind in terms of this notion of inquiry.” In
                this remark, he encapsulates the point of the generational divide between most professors and
                administrators and their students.</P>
            <P class="p45 ft5">The student generation, through safe spaces and trigger warnings, is trying to cultivate
                a certain kind of <NOBR>hyper-tolerant</NOBR> and inclusive campus environment. Dr. Crutcher argues that
                “as educators we are preparing you young people for a world that's troubled, that's very complex and so
                what we need to do at universities and colleges is help</P>
            <P class="p46 ft10">students, those who feel disempowered to kind of look inside themselves and to develop
                the inner strength to push back.” His approach is not to simply categorize safe spaces as</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_11">


            <P class="p47 ft3">an assault on free speech. Rather, he challenges these practices, meant to protect
                marginalized groups, by claiming they undermine the mission of educational institutions to prepare
                students for an <SPAN class="ft2">unsafe </SPAN>world.</P>
            <P class="p48 ft5">Dr. Crutcher continued this position when asked about Dr. Grollman’s opinion piece, which
                claimed that free speech and diversity and inclusion are directly at odds, he responded passionately:
                “you're saying to me that Black and Brown students, they're so precious that we need to shield their
                precious ears from anyone who has anything to say that would be painful or difficult for them to hear. I
                think we have to acknowledge that the microphone is not open to everyone that some underrepresented
                people may feel as though they don't have equal access to the microphone, but again as educators, we
                have to work with them to ensure that they find ways to develop their internal strength, so that they
                can push back in their own way. So I really take offense to that, to be honest with you, because it goes
                back to this thing that people of color are so fragile that they'll be traumatized. If they're exposed
                to contrary arguments, or even hate speech. It's patronizing, in my mind, and I think it aids in the
                oppression of people of color to be quite frank about it.” Dr. Crutcher not only views the reliance on
                safe spaces as dangerous to self identity and personal strength, but recognizes how a dependence creates
                a perpetuation seen in the way faculty treats marginalized students.</P>
            <P class="p49 ft10">He explained, “it really bothers me that there are many of our faculty, particularly
                White liberal faculty, who feel that the approach to helping our Black and Brown students feel as though
                they belong is to wrap their arms around them and protect them. And again, it won't surprise you to hear
                me say that is an abrogation of their responsibility as educators. I'm not saying that we shouldn't have
                support systems, I'm not saying that we shouldn't have multicultural centers, as long as they're open to
                everybody. But I'm saying that if a student goes through four years of a university where they don't
                have any conflict, where they don't have anyone pushing back against their ideas and notions, they are
                not going to be prepared for the real world. Period.” Dr. Crutcher references the kind of freedom of
                <NOBR>association-type</NOBR> safe spaces, such as the Multicultural Center at Richmond, as important
                spaces for a diverse community, without condoning making the classroom a “safe space.”</P>
            <P class="p50 ft3">We asked Dr. Crutcher if he follows the national discourse on safe spaces and trigger
                warnings when making decisions about Richmond, as we’ve found the circumstances of these issues vary
                from campus to campus. He said, “you have to look at the national</P>

            <P class="p51 ft3">discourse; that’s really important. However, one of the reasons why we drafted our own
                free expression statement rather than using the Chicago statement. I feel</P>
            <P class="p52 ft5">very strongly that every school has to ground their approaches to these issues in their
                mission, and their values.” Dr. Crutcher confirmed one of the conclusions we’ve come to: while national
                trends are important, each community is responsible for establishing their own set of practices that
                align most with their values as an institution. Whether trigger warnings and safe spaces align with any
                academic institution’s mission is certainly up for debate.</P>
            <P class="p53 ft11">Lowering the Stakes</P>
            <P class="p54 ft5">After much consideration and research, I, Jonah, have a complicated position. It is
                tempting to construct an argument around the excesses of these practices, but if I am honest they are
                not representative of my general experiences. These arguments are compelling, harnessing what Andrew
                Ujifusa calls “the power of the anecdote” to take bits of reality to make a position about the whole.
                Though they may be exceptions, it is duly unfair to ignore the existence of these excesses entirely. I
                was struck by a trigger warning issued for an <SPAN class="ft4">article</SPAN> on the January 6 attack
                in one of my classes this year. The suggestion that students can or should avoid this material on the
                grounds that it is too upsetting to bear, is absurd and hinders the quality of group discussion and
                learning. Despite this bad experience, among a few others, my common impression of safe spaces and
                trigger warnings, as practiced at Macalester, has been positive.</P>
            <P class="p55 ft5">Regardless of the frequency of the excesses, it is appropriate to lower the stakes of the
                national culture war. We would argue, the kind of offenses safe spaces and trigger warnings are designed
                to prevent are unfortunate byproducts of conflict, not dangerous catastrophes to be avoided at the
                expense of intellectual freedom. Similarly, safe spaces and trigger warnings are not an existential
                threat to free speech, lining dormitory and lecture halls with eggshells. One might ask us, “why then
                have you spent so much time and energy scrutinizing this topic, to ultimately argue for the minimization
                of the issue at hand?” While the national discourse is inflamed, as college students, these issues
                maintain a crucial role in our <NOBR>day-to-day</NOBR> lives. The demands for safe spaces and trigger
                warnings are coming from a narrow contingency of gen z leftists, the very group we belong to. It is our
                responsibility to effectively shape our community environment.</P>

            <P class="p17 ft5">Trying to have a generalized argument about trigger warnings and safe spaces on college
                campuses across the nation is prone to inaccuracies and misleading claims, as the state of these
                practices varies widely from campus to campus. University of Richmond students are vying for the bare
                <NOBR>minimum--reasonable</NOBR> adjustments of decorum to prevent utterly unnecessary offense in the
                face of administrative resistance. Safe spaces and trigger warnings ubiquitous at Macalester College,
                yielding generally positive results with some notable and arguably problematic excesses. Valid
                criticisms of overreaches at campuses like Macalester would undercut a good cause if applied to a campus
                like University of Richmond; appropriate statements advocating for a safe space policy at UR petitioned
                for at Macalester would run the risk of exacerbating excesses.</P>
