<P class="p0 ft0">Black Lives Matter: A Reflection from Different Perspectives</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">By Kailey Blunk, L. Yang, and Marcus Lopez</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">Media’s Portrayal of Black Lives Matter – <SPAN class="ft1">Kailey Blunk</SPAN></P>
<P class="p3 ft1">Growing up in Chicago, I felt like I was constantly hearing about the latest violent crime. The city has often been referenced as the “murder capital” and ranks 7th for 2020 murder rates nationally (Asher and Monkovic). The news regularly failed to phase me, as crime coverage was a <NOBR>never-ending</NOBR> report. I can still remember when Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri and the spread of outrage and the enactment of change throughout the U.S. that never amounted to enough. On the day that George Floyd was brutally murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, it was just another normal day for me. I went to work, went home, slept safely in my college dorm, and knew I would never have to face the issue of being killed or attacked for the color of my skin. I knew that I may never have to face the issues that people of color face, but that does not stop me from educating myself and standing as an ally for those who fight to end police brutality and racial injustice.</P>
<P class="p4 ft1">As I begin to delve into the portrayal of the Black Lives Matter movement in the media, I think it is important to share my identity. I am a leftist, queer, white woman who grew up in the lower middle class in the Chicago suburb of Plainfield. I go to a small private college in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where I study communication, public relations, gender and sexuality, and creative writing. For my entire life I have been privileged by the color of my skin, and the money my parents had to afford me a comfortable lifestyle. The most troubling case of discrimination that I have experienced was sexual harassment, either for being a woman or for my sexuality. Never have I been pulled over and been scared for my life. I am privileged to be able to live in a society and not fear every day that someone may treat me poorly or harshly for the color of my skin.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">As an avid social media user and media researcher, I am well aware of the power social media holds as a platform for the spread of news and activism. In 2014, video footage was spread of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, being killed by New York City police when they put Garner into an illegal chokehold. The video prompted public outcry against police brutality, which was fueled further by the murder of Michael Brown just weeks after Garner’s death (Bonilla and Rosa <NOBR>578-79).</NOBR> Years later, cases of police brutality are just as prevalent. In May of 2020, George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police officers after former officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin down Floyd’s neck to restrain him. Floyd was kept in this position for close to ten minutes as he muttered “I can’t breathe” and lost consciousness (Horn). This murder was captured on video by a teenage bystander who filmed the incident. It is unlikely that this witness, Darnella Frazier, expected that her cellphone video of George Floyd’s death would go on to ignite international protests against racism and police brutality <NOBR>(Bogel-Burroughs</NOBR> and Fazio).</P>
<P class="p6 ft1">One way these videos and other information have been spread is through hashtags. Following the murder of Michael Brown, hashtags such as #Ferguson, #HandsUp, and #IfTheyGunnedMeDown became popular when posting about police brutality and the recurring murders of unarmed black men like Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice. Within one month of Brown’s murder, #Ferguson had been used over eight million times on Twitter. The hashtag was used to send out information regarding the murder and investigation, express support for either Brown or the cop who shot him, and comment on racial tensions and disparity (Bonilla and Rosa). Protestors all over the United States spent months advocating for justice for Brown, and the rising popularity of the hashtags and news made the movement more accessible through ‘hashtag activism.’</P>
<P class="p8 ft1">In a study on the Me Too Movement and 21st century activism, Jamillah Bowman Williams et al. wrote:</P>
<P class="p9 ft3">Although Twitter is not a representative sample of the U.S. population, some have argued that social media activism has fewer divides along the lines of race, class, and gender than the activism of traditional social movements, due to the Internet’s accessibility. Moreover, social media networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others, have become key parts of global and domestic civil society. On the one hand, it seems easier to “belong” on social media than it does in physical space. In a more practical sense, there are fewer barriers to participation, such as geographic restrictions, scarcity of leisure time, and cost. For example, people may be more willing and able to read <NOBR>140-character</NOBR> tweets than travel to attend a live political speech. More individuals also get to take the stage, providing a sense of empowerment that everyone has a voice. Given this broader access, knowledge and information is no longer monopolized by political and economic elites and is communicated faster to the public. This allows for rapid mobilization of groups and gives greater opportunities to engage in public speech. Thus, social media represents a <NOBR>low-cost</NOBR> method through which people are able to organize, connect, and coordinate massive responses to injuries, events, and social change” <NOBR>(377-78).</NOBR></P>
<P class="p11 ft1">Pew Research Center analyst Andrew Perrin reported that, based on a July 2020 survey, 23% of adult social media users in the United States say that their views on political or social issues, such as police brutality, have changed because of the information spread on social media in the past year.</P>
<P class="p12 ft1">As protests rippled throughout the United States and beyond, internationally the media had different ways of portraying the movements. In an article published by the <SPAN class="ft4">Washington Post</SPAN>, Summer Harlow wrote:</P>
<P class="p13 ft1">The typical pattern in media coverage of protests is this: The more radical protesters’ tactics, or the more their aims challenge the status quo, the more delegitimizing the coverage is. Thus, conservative protests tend to receive more favorable coverage than protests seeking radical change, such as Black Lives Matter and <NOBR>anti-racism</NOBR> protests. My own research analyzed about 1,500 <NOBR>protest-related</NOBR> news stories published throughout 2014 in mainstream, alternative, partisan and online news publications. Articles about conservative <NOBR>protests—like</NOBR> protests opposed to immigration or LGBT rights, or protests supporting Trump and gun <NOBR>rights—are</NOBR> less likely to be negatively framed as “riots” than other types of protests. In contrast, Black Lives Matter protests are more likely to be framed as riots, as news coverage focuses more on violence, property damage and confrontations with police.</P>
<P class="p15 ft1">Harlow states that some of these double standards arise because police are deemed more credible sources than protestors due to their ‘official’ status.</P>
<P class="p16 ft1">In an article published by <SPAN class="ft4">Fox News</SPAN>, Hollie McKay describes parts of hashtag activism as "‘cancel culture’ <NOBR>--</NOBR> a form of social <NOBR>media-fueled</NOBR> activism condemned by President Trump but supported in some ways by activists as a tool for achieving social change.” She negatively portrays the call for corporate social responsibility and equity as something that destroys jobs and lives.</P>
<P class="p17 ft1">The differentiating coverage by left and <NOBR>right-leaning</NOBR> media outlets creates conflicting portrayals of movements and events, either working to fit a consumer’s confirmation bias or confusing them about what is really happening. Ideological polarization and depiction of the news further creates divides between those who identify as conservative or liberal. For example, McKay’s tone and diction creates a sensational idea that cancel culture has not created any positive social impact even though it has ruined lives and businesses.</P>
<P class="p18 ft3">This media bias plays into the way consumers understand and form judgements surrounding the news. In some conversations I had with some older friends and family members who receive their news from <NOBR>right-leaning</NOBR> media outlets such as <SPAN class="ft5">Fox News</SPAN>, they called the Black Lives Matter movement a terrorist movement. Similarly, they also attributed Antifa, or the political opposition to fascist and racist ideologies, as being an organized terrorist group.</P>
<P class="p19 ft3">In conversations about the Black Lives Matter movement, I can recall many emotional <NOBR>arguments–shouting,</NOBR> screaming, and <NOBR>crying–over</NOBR> others not listening to their interlocutor’s ideas. It was difficult to make the naïve and blind recognize their privilege and their <NOBR>narrow-minded,</NOBR> pessimistic views of black men being killed and their justifications for the murders. “George Floyd was a criminal. He was on drugs, and he was trying to use counterfeit money.”</P>
<P class="p20 ft1">“He shouldn’t have resisted arrest. The use of force was justified.”</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">But truth be told, none of this matters. George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight by men citizens are supposed to trust. George Floyd’s life was taken unjustly. The police force is not judge and jury, yet Derek Chauvin acted as such. Despite political ideology and beyond any interpretations made, Floyd didn’t deserve unjust treatment or to lose his life over an accusation of a petty crime. It’s for this reason I also don’t support the phrases “all lives matter” and “blue lives matter,” which some pose as <NOBR>‘counter-arguments’</NOBR> to Black Lives Matter. At the end of the day, police officers come home and take off their uniform and they return to living their normal lives. The phrase “black lives matter” is a call for fair treatment and an end to racist acts towards black<SPAN class="ft6">] </SPAN>people. It is not stating that any life matters less than black lives; it is stating that at the end of the day, we all matter, but black people need our help to make sure theirs are safe.</P>
<P class="p22 ft1">It’s hard to go on and watch my black friends struggle to fight an endless battle of asserting themselves as equal beings. The media portrayals of this fight and the Black Lives Matter movement has placed them in a position to be seen as violent protestors and unreasonable people. These distortions are untrue, and I urge all to examine how your media is creating these negative connotations.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_4">


<P class="p0 ft2">Black Lives Matter: A Black Experience <SPAN class="ft1">– Marcus Lopez</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft1">My first experience with the phrase “black lives matter” came before those words became a worldwide movement, <NOBR>non-profit</NOBR> organization, and divisive phrase that has been capitalized on by both sides of the political aisle. It was back in 2014. A simpler time socially, politically, and with no coronavirus to worry about. No, there were only widespread mass shootings while Americans pretended to care about the FIFA World Cup and conversations about the police mistreating black people and other minority groups were taking place across the country. This nationwide conversation (or argument in some places) about police brutality against, and police shootings of, African Americans culminated in the protests/riots that took place in Ferguson, Missouri. Watching videos of this happening was my first exposure to the phrase “black lives matter.” When I saw the video of protestors in Ferguson chanting the phrase "black lives matter," I didn’t think anything of <NOBR>it–­in</NOBR> my eyes, it was nothing but a statement of fact. In my eyes, the phrase seemed like one that only the most bigoted of society would have an issue with anyone saying. I didn’t realize how naïve that line of thinking was.</P>
<P class="p24 ft1">In the years following that first encounter, I heard the phrase more and more, especially whenever there was an incident of police misconduct involving African Americans. As the phrase proliferated throughout the American lexicon and culture, I never once thought of it as a movement but as a statement of fact. I’ve always believed that everyone’s life holds equal value, so I had no issue saying that black lives matter. To me, the phrase did not mean "black lives matter more" or "only black lives matter" but that black lives matter as much as the life of anyone from any other race. I am an African American who’s been the victim of unprovoked harassment by the police in my youth, so it seemed only natural to me that when police were killing African Americans for unjustified or indefinite reasons, we should say to those same people that black life does matter: they’re the ones acting like it doesn’t matter. Because that’s exactly how it feels when you feel targeted or mistreated by the police: like your life doesn't matter. So, hearing African Americans chanting the phrase “black lives matter” was only a natural reaction to that mistreatment. No matter what organization takes on the phrase as their name, to me and the rest of the black community, the phrase “black lives matter” only means that the life of any African American matters just as much as anyone else’s life.</P>
<P class="p25 ft1">As the term “black lives matter” became more and more of a popular term and eventually a global movement in the wake of the murder of George Floyd’s murder in the summer of 2020, I heard a <NOBR>counter-phrase</NOBR> being used more frequently. I first noticed it being used in the comment sections of social media posts and news stories. You’ve heard it before; it’s “all lives matter.” Also, a word often used along with this phrase was “no” often combined in the form “No, all lives matter.” It was an odd response to the phrase “black lives matter,” one that always raised a few questions in my mind. How can you respond with the word “no” when someone says that their life matters? If all lives matter, then doesn’t that also mean that black lives matter? And if you have an issue saying that a certain race’s lives matter (assuming that all lives matter equally) isn’t that racist? Responding with “all lives matter” to “black lives matter'' isn't an assertion that all lives matter. It’s an attempt to say that black lives do not matter as much as anyone else’s. Unfortunately, these are questions that people don’t want to be asked or ask themselves.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_5">


<P class="p26 ft1">But speaking of questions, there is one that not many think about when it comes to this topic. Who was pushing the narratives that led to this misguided view of a simple phrase, a phrase that was popularized by those seeking justice in Ferguson, Missouri? The answer is a simple one: the dichotomized American media landscape. This isn’t to say that there weren’t any reputable news sources reporting on the growing Black Lives Matter movement without bias, but many more news sources were putting their spin on what the Black Lives Matter movement was about.</P>
<P class="p27 ft1">The expert pundits at Fox News Network and similar <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> news organizations told the public that the Black Lives Matter movement was nothing but a domestic terrorist organization that was staunchly <NOBR>anti-American.</NOBR> Bill O’Reilly even said that the Black Lives Matter movement was “killing Americans” on his Fox News T.V. show <SPAN class="ft4">The O’Reilly Factor</SPAN>. Another popular Fox News pundit, Tucker Carlson claimed that the Black Lives Matter Movement and its supporters were looking to “remake and control the country” in an article he wrote for the Fox News website. This negative attitude towards the Black Lives Matter movement wasn’t just isolated to a few rogue <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> pundits either. Entire news organizations like OANN, the One America News Network, characterized the Black Lives Matter movement as <NOBR>anti-American</NOBR> criminals. Multiple OANN hosts even called the Black Lives Matter movement a “farce” and a “criminal front group,” two completely false statements. This isn’t to say that <NOBR>right-wing</NOBR> news organizations were the only ones to blame, because while <NOBR>left-wing</NOBR> news organizations like NBC weren’t against the Black Lives Matter movement, they got caught up reporting how many riots and protests were happening. This didn’t help how people viewed the Black Lives Matter Movement. I understand that they were simply reporting what was going on and even attempting to show how many people support the Black Lives Matter movement, but all some people saw were “kids” rioting or worse.</P>
<P class="p28 ft1">Most major and even <NOBR>mid-major</NOBR> news organizations just didn’t do what most news organizations refuse to do whenever there is an issue: talk to the people at the very center of said issue. It wasn’t very often that I saw an organization talk to individual protestors or even the people who organized the protests. No, what was reported instead were the reactions to the protest and riots but no real attempt to understand what these protestors were trying to achieve. Because whether you get your news from the left, right, or middle, the chances that you heard a protestor or organizer speak about why they were protesting is almost slim to none. That’s why if someone wanted to know what the Black Lives Matter movement was about, the answer would depend on who they asked. If you ask most African Americans, staunch liberals, or even look at blacklivesmatter.com you’d get one answer. Then, if the same person were to turn around and ask a staunch conservative, or someone who has only consumed conservative media, they’d get a very different answer. And when everyone has an answer, there isn’t an answer. This is why news organizations that present complex issues that they, or the public at large, do not have a personal stake in need to be careful and communicate more than telling. Through communication, the public would have been able to more easily understand why protests were happening and what the protestors wanted. Instead, when every news organization had the chance to communicate with protesters yelling “black lives matter,” and when they could have allowed those protestors to speak on their own behalf, they didn’t. News organizations committed to telling the ‘truth’ each took their best guess as to what all those protests were about and reported it to the public as fact. It was sad as a black person living in the United States to watch a movement meant to better people who look like me being used as another tool to further their agenda. This isn’t me explaining why I don’t support the Black Lives Matter movement (because I do), but rather why I lament the commoditization of the phrase into a political and corporate tool.</P>
<P class="p30 ft1">As an African American living in the United States, when I hear someone say that black lives matter, I can only bring myself to agree. Not due to any political leaning, but because I am an African American, and there isn’t anything that makes my existence any less valuable than the existence of anyone else.</P>
<P class="p8 ft2">An International Perspective <SPAN class="ft1">– by L. Yang</SPAN></P>
<P class="p31 ft1">An ancient Chinese proverb teaches, “The spectators see the games better than the players.” I respond, “But aren’t we all players in the game of life?”</P>
<P class="p32 ft1">When George Floyd was choked to death by a white police officer in May 2020, I do not remember where I read about it, because it was all over the news. Frankly, I did not have a strong initial reaction. Many Chinese people shared the same response as mine. I knew this by reading the comments, which were composed of different words, but told the same story: conflicts between American police and African Americans have existed for a long time. We have grown accustomed to it.</P>
<P class="p33 ft3">Our reactions appeared so calm, as I thought afterward. Chinese people tend to be proud of our emotionless state. Of course, rarely is anyone born with such mental preparedness. Chinese people trained ourselves and our children to minimize reactions. It is a skill developed later in life. We believe that we have a good reason: emotions push the players to make the wrong move, but spectators usually analyze others’ games logically, for their interests can not be affected anyway. We like to position ourselves as spectators. After all, who wants to be a fool?</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">However, being calm is not okay in every situation, especially when we are faced with extremely traumatic tragedies that impact everyone’s life, such as Floyd’s death. There are two reasons: first, a life passed away. George Floyd may be a symbol now. He might be a trigger for the national protests. But most importantly, he was a living person. He had family and friends. He used to contribute to the community. He was a part of someone’s best memory. Calmly reading about his death and judging the incident emotionlessly could appear intelligent, but these reactions are in fact <NOBR>cold-blooded.</NOBR> Indeed, the media has delivered much news on police brutality and racial conflicts in the U.S. What frightens me is that we become numb through the course of time. However, since we are not always <NOBR>numb–we</NOBR> still react with anger to felonies that harm Chinese <NOBR>people–we</NOBR> become selfish and are filled with hatred.</P>
<P class="p35 ft1">Emotionlessly judging Floyd’s death as if this event has no impact on us is not wise either; because this time, we are players in the Black Lives Matter movement. As for an event as global as Black Lives Matter, everyone is inevitably affected. No matter which race or ethnicity one identifies with, people can feel the threats, see the opportunities, hear the silent desperation and be infiltrated with hatred, and even glimpse their future through Black Lives Matter. No one is exempt from these experiences. Now, does judging the death of Floyd emotionlessly, cynically, and sarcastically look smart? I am afraid not.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_7">


<P class="p36 ft1">I genuinely hoped that I was not the only one concerned about how Black Lives Matter would affect us. There were Chinese people, mostly those who study or work abroad and are under the influence of the left who realized the same. But this was not the case for the majority, who remain in China for most of their life and are immersed in nationalism. Hate speech in reference to George Floyd’s killing was and still is prevalent in Chinese social media. In May and June 2020, journalists and common users on Tik Tok and WeChat, the media platforms that are most popular in China, focused on reporting violence that occurred after Floyd’s death, trying to paint a picture of “the Fall of the United States due to its Idiotic Democracy.” On the other side of the ocean, Chinese people witnessed the robbery, shooting, and physical assaults along with the protests that took place all over the states. By then, the covid pandemic was severe in the United States. Cases were skyrocketing in just a few days. Many Chinese internet users laughed at the United States. They remembered, and the Chinese media reminded them, that months ago, Nancy Pelosi seemed to refer to the violent protest in Hong Kong as “a beautiful sight to behold,” so they used the same quote to refer to the violent protest in the United States as revenge.</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">This was pathetic. Many of them failed to realize that they were fooled by the bias of the Chinese media. In fact, according to Polygraph.info, a Western media outlet, Pelosi only used this phrase to address the peaceful protests in Hongkong (Castro). Chinese people can not read Polygraph because the Chinese government has been blocking access to Western websites for a long time. If one really tries to access Western sources by using a VPN, he/she can, but many didn’t care about going through such troubles to dig into the truth. The world was in chaos and the ‘spectators’ were celebrating. Due to governmental control of the media and the willful assertion of political bias in the news, many Chinese commentators called the U.S. government incompetent and the protestors foolish opportunists who just wanted to gain personal profits from their activism.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">There is no need to spend paragraphs on the <NOBR>long-term</NOBR> conflict between the U.S. and China. Chinese media speak ill of the states just as the American media defame us. Each country’s media passes the hatred to their people. I grew up in China and went to school in the U.S. since 8th grade. I have been familiar with the cultures in both states. I have acquired the skill to critically assess news coming from both countries, just so that I do not suffocate in ignorance and unreasonable fury.</P>
<P class="p39 ft1">The conflicts between American and Chinese people are serious. To explain this situation, I agree with the opinion of my advisor, Miles Allen, that “our divided media spheres likely play a large role in harming our understanding of each other” (Allen). A lie does not become a fact until most people embrace it. The media has the power to disguise lies and plant doubts, spread rumors and create consensus. If what we know determines who we are, then the media is our creator and we are its puppets. However, perhaps the media is not <NOBR>all-powerful.</NOBR> The consensus it creates develops mostly on its own. This is when the media becomes our puppet.</P>
<P class="p27 ft1">A twist to the Black Lives Matter movement exemplifies how the media becomes a puppet for some people. It did not take long for people to misinterpret the fundamental, bona fide purpose of Black Lives Matter, because when some people chew on the words “Black Lives Matter,” they conclude that it suggests that other lives do not matter. The confused internet users shared their misinterpretation of this message and incurred a variety of reactions. One of those reactions was that some Chinese people could not endure Asian Hate anymore, so they promoted the slogan Asian Lives Matter. Commentators who support these proposals expressed that the U.S. put too much focus on white and the black, leaving Asians and other minority groups sinking to their graves in their lack of representation; in addition, they accused Black Lives Matter of spreading black superiority, using their historical disadvantage to immorally take advantage of others today. Another reaction is the proposal of All Lives Matter, as opposed to Black Lives Matter. The argument behind this reaction is that since all lives matter, only emphasizing black people’s lives seems unfair. As I remember, these articles and videos led to a nationwide increase in discrimination against black people in China. More Chinese people believed that black people are criminals or <NOBR>criminals-to-be</NOBR> and that Black Lives Matter was social unrest that should be suppressed.</P>
<P class="p24 ft1">I experienced enough twists and turns in the consensus to mute myself from expressing my opinion about Black Lives Matter. I know people who once supported this movement and all of a sudden despised it. It was scary to watch <NOBR>them–they</NOBR> said the words the media told them to say, then they changed their opinions once the media changed its mind. Their lack of critical thinking shocked me. It has been over a year since Floyd’s death. Black Lives Matter is fading from the public’s attention in China. Chinese people went from having a clear stand to being overwhelmed by confusion.</P>
<P class="p41 ft1">When it is brought up in conversation, people tend to portray the movement as a dog fight without a just party. Unfortunately, most Chinese people enjoy waiting for the event to become more dramatic, causing more casualties, just so that the “antagonist of righteous China” can fall apart sooner. Whether the media cares to realize it or not, it is sowing violence in people’s hearts and urging them to fight each other.</P>
<P class="p42 ft1">I fear the media, for I hesitate to trust it. I fear having an opinion, for it could be biased and expressing it may hurt the innocent. In my world, where the media dominates, the players of the game are bleeding, and those who think they are spectators are applauding. Only a few care about making rational solutions so we can have peace; most people amuse themselves to <NOBR>death–they</NOBR> adore the gory games until their beloved <NOBR>real-life</NOBR> thrillers come to their doorsteps. By then, they will cry out, “I can’t breathe” and other “spectators” will enjoy watching the scene, calling it “a beautiful sight to behold.”</P>
