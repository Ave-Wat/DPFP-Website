            <P class="p1 ft1">Jared Garson and Ellen Wilhelm</P>
            <P class="p2 ft1">The following is a refined conversation between a liberal and conservative about the topic
                of climate change and how it should be addressed. The liberal on the left is in blue and the
                conservative on the right is in red.</P>
            <P class="p3 ft3">The US has procrastinated climate action for long enough. We’ve known since before the
                21st century that the increasing global temperature is on track to alter our very way of life if we
                don’t address it sooner rather than later. Now that it <SPAN class="ft2">is </SPAN>later, everything we
                should have been doing over the last twenty years needs to be compressed into the next ten. The first
                step is to heavily invest in renewable energy so we can reach <NOBR>net-zero</NOBR> emissions as soon as
                possible. The next step is to shift technology from <NOBR>carbon-powered</NOBR> to <NOBR>
                    electricity-powered,</NOBR> so renewable energy can power parts of the market that it couldn't
                before. To get here, we’ll need to apply a carbon tax to discourage carbon emissions, encourage <NOBR>
                    carbon-neutral</NOBR> business models, and fund investment in sustainable technology.</P>
            <P class="p4 ft1">In an analysis of climate change as a social issue, <A
                    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249404025_The_Emergency_of_Climate_Change_Why_Are_We_Failing_to_Take_Action"><SPAN
                        class="ft4">Frantz and Mayer</SPAN></A> conclude that successful action demands continued <SPAN
                    class="ft5">collective action</SPAN>, and collective action demands convenience. Many people will
                not take individual action unless it is easy and directly in front of them. Instead of <NOBR>
                    fear-mongering,</NOBR> it’s important to provide solutions by pushing for <NOBR>climate-neutral
                </NOBR> public transportation instead of the widening of major highways, for example. <NOBR><A
                        href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1173-5"><SPAN
                            class="ft4">Roser-Renouf</SPAN></A></NOBR><A
                    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1173-5"><SPAN class="ft4"> et
                        al.</SPAN></A> conducted a study to distinguish the key beliefs that lead to political action.
                They conclude that “legislation is unlikely without … citizen activism.” Big governments will not enact
                carbon limits without public pressure and there will be no public pressure if we cannot come together to
                demand collective action as a country. In a study assessing collectivist and individualist cultures, <A
                    href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00187/full"><SPAN class="ft4">Kiang et
                        al.</SPAN></A> found that if the government is unsupportive of <NOBR>climate-friendly</NOBR>
                behavior, companies will not invest in <NOBR>climate-friendly</NOBR> opportunities, which will “foster
                consumers’ climate change inaction.”</P>
            <P class="p5 ft6">There is still significant uncertainty in the scientific community as to whether your
                timeline is accurate. To a certain extent, Democrats have exaggerated Climate Change’s urgency. I agree
                that Climate Change exists and that it is an issue, but I don’t think we’ll reach a ‘point of no return’
                where humanity’s course in history becomes irreversible.</P>
            <P class="p6 ft1"><A
                    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249404025_The_Emergency_of_Climate_Change_Why_Are_We_Failing_to_Take_Action"><SPAN
                        class="ft4">Frantz and Mayer</SPAN></A> reference Latane and Darley’s model of helping behavior
                in an emergency and they tie it to climate change inaction. They argue that five criteria must
                be met in order for a person to help. They must notice the event in question, interpret the event as an
                emergency, feel personally responsible, know what to do to help, and finally, make the decision to act.
                A person can notice an event but fail to act because they do not see it as an emergency. That is exactly
                what is happening with many Americans.</P>
            <P class="p8 ft3">There’s a consistent scientific consensus that the global temperature is on track to
                increase by a destructive amount of degrees. I don’t know if you can claim that the scientific
                community’s timeline is inaccurate.</P>

        <DIV id="page_2">


            <P class="p9 ft6">Whether the planet heats up by 1.5 degrees Celsius or 3 degrees Celsius over the next 100
                years, there are many strategies like sea walls that humans can use to adapt until we get to the point
                where moving away from fossil fuels is economically feasible. As of right now, if we implemented many of
                the policies that Democrats tend to champion, the working class and especially the lower class would be
                hit the hardest.</P>
            <P class="p10 ft1">Again, we see some people struggle with the notion of recognizing climate change as an
                emergency. <A
                    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249404025_The_Emergency_of_Climate_Change_Why_Are_We_Failing_to_Take_Action"><SPAN
                        class="ft4">Frantz and Mayer</SPAN></A> note several reasons as to why a person may fail to
                assess a situation as an emergency: it can be difficult to notice a degree or two Celsius change,
                especially since climate changes are not equal across the globe. Some regions are hit harder than
                others, and the effects of climate change can manifest differently. People also spend far more time
                indoors in <NOBR>climate-controlled</NOBR> environments than in generations past. Less time outdoors
                equates to being less deeply rooted in their local environment, and thus less likely to notice the
                subtle changes like slight temperature increases.</P>
            <P class="p11 ft3">They’ll be hit the hardest if we can’t properly mitigate Climate Change. <NOBR>Low-income
                </NOBR> communities are the most vulnerable to forest fires, droughts, flooding, and job insecurity, all
                of which will continue to increase at a frightening rate. But that’s beside the point because investing
                in renewable energy won’t hurt the economy; if anything, it’ll make it stronger! Investing in green
                technology would create <SPAN class="ft2">many </SPAN>more jobs than it would erase, not to mention it
                would do the economy a favor by phasing out an outdated and harmful technology with a more sustainable
                alternative.</P>
            <P class="p12 ft6">Investing in renewable energy isn’t the problem. The problem is when the government hikes
                up the cost of energy with taxes or by ending fossil fuel subsidies. Many states heavily rely on the oil
                industry to keep their communities afloat, and their economy would crumble if it was taken away. You
                mentioned a carbon tax earlier, which is essentially a tax that companies pay for emitting carbon. A
                carbon tax would cause two things to happen: first, many companies that the country depends on for jobs
                and revenue would relocate to a different country without a carbon tax. It’s just the smart financial
                move to make; second, the companies that remain in the US would just pass these costs onto the consumer
                by charging higher prices for gas, heating, and electricity. <NOBR>Low-income</NOBR> households tend to
                be the most reliant on carbon technology and the least capable of transitioning to newer, expensive
                renewable technology. The truth is that a carbon tax would hurt the working and lower class, and would
                stifle economic growth too.</P>
            <P class="p13 ft3">Corporations aren’t excused to pollute and exploit the environment just because they’re
                in the US. They need to be held accountable for their harmful business practices. And if these
                businesses do pass some of the carbon tax on to the consumer and the cost of energy goes up for the
                working and lower class, there are ways around that. For instance, the carbon tax could fund a monthly
                check that would go to the most impacted Americans.</P>
            <P class="p14 ft1"><A
                    href="https://taxfoundation.org/sweden-carbon-tax-revenue-greenhouse-gas-emissions/"><SPAN
                        class="ft4">Sweden’s carbon tax</SPAN></A> was one of the first to be implemented, and it has
                been a success. They have simultaneously reduced carbon emissions and maintained GDP growth. In 2019,
                the carbon tax raised 2.3 billion USD. From its implementation in 1990 until 2018, Sweden’s carbon
                emissions decreased by 27%. On its own, it might not sound like much, but imagine the global impact that
                could have if every country followed suit. Sweden isn’t the only country to successfully implement carbon taxes either; so have Finland and Canada.</P>
            <P class="p17 ft6">The point I’m trying to make is that the market will naturally adjust to a more
                sustainable technology over time, so enforcing a carbon tax would just stunt the economy for no good
                reason. It’s important to strike a balance between moving away from fossil fuels and also protecting the
                health of the economy, both of which can happen as the market naturally adjusts.</P>
            <P class="p18 ft3">If we had all the time in the world, we would <SPAN class="ft2">eventually </SPAN>move
                away from fossil fuels and embrace more sustainable forms of energy without government intervention. The
                problem is that we don’t have all the time in the world. Whether we have 10 years or 20 years to address
                this issue, if we don’t make a significant effort to combat climate change by then, many, <SPAN
                    class="ft2">many </SPAN>people, not just in the US but around the world, will suffer from even more
                severe weather, rising oceans, and frequent forest fires. The market is not on track to <SPAN
                    class="ft2">naturally </SPAN>adopt renewable energy in time to avoid these disasters, so it needs a
                push from the government to get there.</P>
            <P class="p19 ft1">As previously mentioned, a person must interpret an event as an emergency before acting.
                Here we have an example of what it looks like to not only interpret the climate change issue as an
                emergency, but also feel personally responsible, know what to do to help, and finally make the decision
                to act. This is <A href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1173-5"><SPAN
                        class="ft4">citizen activism</SPAN></A> at work.</P>
            <P class="p20 ft6">Let's say that hypothetically the US does become carbon neutral by 2050. We aren’t even
                the biggest carbon emitters in the world. What’s the point of spending all this money eliminating fossil
                fuels if China will just continue polluting and polluting? Nearly none of the countries that signed the
                Paris Climate Agreement are on track to meet their goal. If the US somehow manages to go carbon neutral,
                it won’t even put a dent in the problem you’re talking about.</P>
            <P class="p21 ft3">The US is responsible for emitting more greenhouse gases than any other country in the
                world. Currently, China’s overtaken us, but we’ve still had an enormous output over the years. Once the
                US develops better renewable technology, the country can regain its place as a global leader in the
                world. The US could invest its technology in other developing countries, saving them resources, gaining
                influence, and putting pressure on other countries as well. It seems like a <NOBR>win-win</NOBR>
                situation.</P>
            <P class="p22 ft3"><A href="https://www.c2es.org/content/international-emissions/"><SPAN class="ft4">The
                        United States’ per capita greenhouse gas emissions</SPAN></A><SPAN class="ft1"> for 2017 was
                    about 3.5 tons of CO2 per person higher than Russia, and far outranking Japan, </SPAN>

                        class="ft4">The Carbon Brief</SPAN></A><SPAN class="ft1"> also cited the US as having the
                    largest CO2 emissions since 1750. Carbon emissions are a cumulative problem, but as a global leader
                    and one of the worst carbon emissions offenders, it is of critical importance that the US set a
                </SPAN>
                <NOBR><SPAN class="ft1">climate-friendly</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> precedent for the rest of the
                    world to follow.</SPAN>
            </P>
            <P class="p23 ft6">Fortunately, I’m on board with investing in renewable energy, but not proposals like a
                carbon tax which would harm the American worker. As of right now, the biggest hindrance to renewable
                energy is that when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing, it’s harder to generate
                electricity. That’s why we can both agree that the US should invest in sustainable alternatives like
                nuclear energy while building better batteries that can hold massive stores of energy.</P>
        </DIV>
        <DIV id="page_4">


            <P class="p24 ft1">In the study conducted by <A
                    href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00187/full"><SPAN class="ft4">Xiang et

                denial, conflicting goals and aspirations, and tokenism. The above argument is a prime example of
                conflicting goals and aspirations. The conservative may agree that as a society, we should be investing
                in sustainable energy, but they also may not agree that instituting a carbon tax is the way to
                accomplish the goal. Thus from their perspective, the goal of sustainability and the aspiration of a
                carbon tax cannot coexist.</P>
            <P class="p27 ft3">I think any money we can invest in sustainable energy would be money well spent. I’m glad

                more intent on carbon taxes than you are, I’m glad that we have a starting point. Once we begin
                investing more in renewable energy, we can decide on the next step.</P>
