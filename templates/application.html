      <h2>Opportunity</h2>
          <p>The Panorama Project offers motivated and open-minded students from across the U.S. an opportunity to understand experiences and opinions that are different from their own by collaborating on pieces of media that explore pressing issues in U.S. politics.
            <ul class="circle">
              <li>In teams of two to four, participants will research, discuss, and collaborate on a piece of media on a topic in U.S. politics (for example, a news article, feature, explainer-video, or even an art piece). Participants can draw on their own experiences, interviews, academic sources, news articles, works of art, and historical resources -- including an exclusive <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/community/government-affairs/study-of-congress/research-and-initiatives/reflections-project0.html" target="_blank">archive of interviews</a> with former members of Congress -- to research and tell their stories.</li>
              <li>Along the way, participants will have the opportunity to meet, learn from, and discuss their work with various experts on U.S. politics, including John Harris, the co-founder of Politico. The summer of research will culminate in a roundtable discussion, where professors, policy-makers, and journalists weigh in on our work and its relevance to U.S. politics.</li>
              <li>Participants will receive a $60 award for their completed contribution to the project.</li>
              <li>Thi is a part-time summer commitment that will ask for about 3-5 hours of work per week (aside from participation in workshops and events). All work will be done remotely.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>Duties and Responsibilities</h2>
