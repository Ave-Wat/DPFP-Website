<P class="p0 ft0">A Brief History of How the Hell We Ended Up Here</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">Taylor Pisani and Kathryn Looff</P>
<P class="p2 ft1">When supporters of Donald J. Trump stormed the United States Capitol building in the early afternoon on January 6th, many news outlets immediately cried out in outrage. “No American should minimize or forget the horror of Jan. 6.” argued the <SPAN class="ft2">Washington Post.</SPAN> “The physical violence experienced was..horrific and terrifying”, wrote <SPAN class="ft2">CNN.</SPAN> While unprecedented in history, there were signs in history that some thing of the sort was coming. American discord, fueled by Donald Trump, combined with the disenfranchisement of his voters, unfortunately, added up to the only time that the Capitol had been stormed since the British invasion during the war of 1812. Throughout history, America has been fueled by discord and decisiveness, and it seems that oftentimes it is this discord that fuels progress.Progress, however, can lead to promises, and when these promises are no longer fulfilled, you have an American people who are now discount with the way of living. It is this deadly combination of discord and discontent that led to the attack on the Capitol on January 6th.</P>
<P class="p3 ft3">In a sense, America was born out of discord. After the last signature had been added to the Declaration of Independence, the whole room, full of mostly young idealists, knew that the world had turned upside down. Worst case scenario, everyone who signed that document would be executed in a horrible manner, best case scenario, every young idealist would now be tasked with creating a whole, brand new country. What followed was an aggressive seven years of fighting, politicking, and planning. As soon as the smoke settled in the last battle in the South, it was back to the drawing board to solve a new <NOBR>problem--the</NOBR> political organization of a brand new country. It was what many of the Founders, being political philosophers themselves, had dreamed of: a completely blank slate. Some, like Alexander Hamilton, argued for something along the lines of a constitutional monarchy, even offering to have King George’s cousin shipped in, while others, like Thomas Jefferson, wanted a government so limited it would barely even exist. What first came about was a document that leaned more toward the Jeffersonian idea of government: the Articles of Confederation. Under the articles, Congress served as more of a figurehead force, instead of a true political body that could enact change. This was an issue even during the war, but now that there was peacetime it became a bigger problem. Congress could not enforce laws or pay taxes, which made it virtually impossible for the new American government to pay the veterans (since they had signed on with the promise of payment, but very often never got paid during the war). However, to amend the articles, all thirteen states would have to agree on an amendment. The proposition of an amendment to allow Congress to tax failed in both 1781 and 1786. It was after the failure of 1786 that delegates from states began to meet to draft what would eventually become the Constitution.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">However, even after the Constitution was adopted, the financial problems of America led to the nation’s first major <NOBR>uprising--the</NOBR> Whiskey Rebellion. Because of a new tax on whiskey, there was a formation of protest since the tax was deemed unfair to small producers. When the tax was not lifted, however, violence against tax collectors began. Tax collectors were intimidated, tarred and feathered, and had their homes broken into for simply doing their jobs. Between 1791 and 1794 this violence against the tax collectors got so bad that Washington was forced to send in the army. This rebellion is widely considered to be the first test of governmental authority in the new United States, but it is also a sign of the discontent of the people. The new republic was around only for a couple of years before the people ran into an issue that resulted in a revolt, and it would certainly not be the last revolt that the country would experience. In the political sphere, discord continued well into the early republic. Although specifically told by George Washington not to, the country’s young political elite soon split into two political <NOBR>parties--the</NOBR> Democratic Republicans, headed by Thomas Jefferson, and the Federalists, headed by Alexander Hamiltion. Both parties represented the opposite of the other, with Democratic Republicans advocating for a looser, more <NOBR>state-centric</NOBR> government, while the Federalists believed in a strong central government. Jefferson and Hamilton sparked the fire that would soon become the flames that engulfed America. Political polarization began with the feud between Jefferson and Hamilton and would continue to the present day. Although parties have switched names and positions a few times, the animosity started by Jefferson and Hamilton has remained prevalent in political cultures.</P>
<P class="p7 ft3">Time continued on, however, and soon America was in the era of Expansion. Manifest Destiny was the name of the <NOBR>game--the</NOBR> idea that America was destined by God to expand its territories and expand civilization throughout the whole continent. An explosion in population led to President Thomas Jefferson purchasing an expanse of French territory in 1803, buying approximately 828,000 square miles from Napoleon. This land was considered uninhabited, so Jefferson sent two <NOBR>explorers--Lewis</NOBR> and <NOBR>Clark--to</NOBR> go explore the land. What returned was a scientific study of the flora and fauna of the purchase, which inspired others to adventure out on their own and claim the land (officially) for America. The annexation of Texas, the Oregon territory, and Spanish Florida fueled the idea that America would soon be a coast to coast country. However, his idea not only justified mass movement to the West, but also the systematic genoicide of Native Americans.vIt seems that one of the few things that kept America united during this time was the idea that there was more ‘America’ to discover. However, Manifest Destiny can be easily boiled down into a greedy land grab that resulted in the death and destruction of an entire race. Numerous native wars plagued the country, along with a war with Mexico. America was unified under the idea of Manifest Destiny, to the point where multiple wars were <NOBR>fought--sewing</NOBR> hatred and discord with both natives and neighbors. America, although not an enemy of itself during this time, was certainly an enemy of other countries and peoples. What came next could be argued the most intensely political time that the country has ever experienced. After decades of simmering tensions, the Civil War broke out officially in 1861. How did America move from an era of patriotism to fighting their own brother? However, because of the industrialization that occurred in the previous era, there became a distinct difference between the northern and southern United States. The north was focused on manufacturing, and the south was focused on agriculture. As abolitionist movements began to grow in the North, the south rebelled against the idea, since they were unfortunately dependent on slave labor. Therefore, tensions rose based on the idea of slavery and its emormous economic impact. In 1854, Congress passed the <NOBR>Kansas-Nebraska</NOBR> act, which opened up all new territories to slavery by the rule of popular sovergnity, which led to fraud and fighting over these territories in events such as “Bleeding Kansas”. After events such as John Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry, southerners became increasingly convinced that the north was working to take the backbone of their <NOBR>economy--the</NOBR> right to own another human <NOBR>being--away</NOBR> from them. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 was the final straw. Southern states, who felt like their vote did not count, began to secede from the Union. Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia all left the Union and formed their <NOBR>own--the</NOBR> Confederate States of America. Fighting officially broke out over Fort Sumter in 1861, and what followed were the bloodiest years in United States history. There was never a more divided time in American history, and it should be noted that in the modern day, many members of the Southern states (especially Texas) have been repeatedly calling for secession after the 2020 election.</P>
<P class="p10 ft3">After the Civil War came the challenge of Reconstruction. The Confederate states had lost the war after four long years, and many who lived in that era were not keen on rejoining the country that they felt did not represent them. Along with those who did not want to be citizens of the United States, there were four million people who <NOBR>did--the</NOBR> newly freed slaves. However, with the passing of the “Black Codes” under president Andrew Johnson, there seemed to be a new divide that plagues <NOBR>America--not</NOBR> between North and South anymore, but between Black and White. After 1867, more southern whites turned to violence to discourage black participation in society. The Klu Klux Klan was founded during this time, with the intent to challenge and scare those who opposed white southern authority. Violence and economic depression led to the Democratic <NOBR>Party--a</NOBR> party that supported the Klan and violence in the <NOBR>South--to</NOBR> take control of the House of Representatives in 1874, the first time since the Civil War. The compromise of 1876 effectively ended the reconstruction period, but racial tensions and divisions would continue long into the future, with the legacy of the civil war and <NOBR>reconstruction--and</NOBR> arguments about what it was really <NOBR>about--continuing</NOBR> to challenge the United States today.</P>
<P class="p11 ft4">Even with all this tension, America still managed to enter an era of prosperity. The “Gilded Age”, a term coined by Mark Twain, had begun. The market boomed and America rushed toward a new age of industrialization, but there was a more sinister side to all this progress. A new rank of man formed, the <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> “Robber <NOBR>Barons”--men</NOBR> who were incredibly rich, but usually at the cost of their workers. While some, like Andrew Carnige, built over 1,700 libraries throughout America, it was still money made from the abuse of his workers. In general, robber barons were relentless in their gain for wealth, often union busting and ignoring the law in favor of their own personal gain. Therefore, on top of the divide between races came another <NOBR>divide--that</NOBR> between the rich and the poor. The wealthy elite saw those who worked for them as a commodity to be exploited, not a worker that deserved rights. Although there were workers unions that emerged during this time, they were often ignored or broken by the robber barons, who preferred more money in their pocket over the <NOBR>well-being</NOBR> of their workers<SPAN class="ft5">.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft4">It seems as if Americans could never catch a break. Each era of assumed peace brought on an intensity of chaos for the nation. The sheer joy and carelessness of the Roaring 20s followed into the <NOBR>life-wrecking</NOBR> Great Depression. If we put a lens to the Roaring 20s we see streets paved with gold and hopeful eyes as far as the land could see. The stock market was booming, buying on credit was life changing for most households, and people were starry eyed for a prosperous American future that was led by Coolidge and carried on the backs of themselves. This all came to a crashing halt on one October day known in infamy as Black Tuesday. Black Tuesday exposed the cracks in the people’s golden America and would lead to turning those <NOBR>starry-eyed</NOBR> Americans into starving sunken eyed hopeless individuals that once held so much potential. The Great Depression snapped the once sought after American Dream in half and brought food lines, extreme unemployment, and the infamous “Hoovervilles”. As the Depression worsened, the people decided it was time for a new leader to get them out of their rut. The people made their voices heard and elected Franklin Delano Roosevelt who won a majority of the electoral vote and overtook Hoover by about 7 million in the popular vote. FDR got to work immediately, with the help of Congress he implemented his New Deal plans that were intended to fix the depression and prevent something like it from ever happening again. Although some of FDR’s New Deal plans unraveled, such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act, most of the programs helped reform, recover, and relieve Americans. America was finally getting back to a peaceful era...until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. There were events that happened before the bombing that put the Americans on the brink of joining the war but the attack on Pearl Harbor put us over the edge. Americans seemed to embrace wartime in a sense. Rosie the Riveter was born, women were working factory jobs, American’s were securing war time wins in numerous ways, and African Americans were able to work industrial jobs. The federal government strengthened their involvement in the American people and no one seemed to mind too much.</P>
<P class="p15 ft4">After the Allies won the war, America saw a multitude of events over the years such as the Baby Boom, the Civil Rights Movement beginning, and the need to pursue the American dream continued. The 1950s and 1960s brought on great social changes to the lives of all Americans. There was intense criticism of the government at this time especially if we look into the segregation of African Americans. Looking back on Plessy vs. Ferguson, it was ruled that between whites and blacks everything would be separate but equal. However we were moving into a time where this ruling would be disputed by African Americans and their white allies who believed the same thing. The desegregation of schools is a great example to look at here. After the Brown v. Board of Education decision, most schools down South did not embrace the immediate change. They closed most of their schools instead of deciding to integrate them, but still made sure white children were going to “Private Academies”. Little Rock, Arkansas sent the national guard to prevent the segregation of black teenagers into a high school and in response Eisenhower sent the Airborne Division to walk the African American teenagers into school for about a year. People in the South got extremely into this resistance to the point where some states were flying the confederate flags on their state buildings. One of my favorite things about this that ties into the insurrection is that the people who were protesting the desegregation of schools are parents and grandparents who are still involved in society today and who have raised children that are involved in society today. The undeniable connection between the people who invaded the capital and being extremely racist also has a connection to the rise of conservatism that took place during the 60s and 70s. This would allude to the fact that the same people who didn’t want black people in their schools participated, or had children who participated in, the insurrection which was mainly participated by conservative/republican idealistic individuals. People were mad that the government would do something as postposperous as letting black children learn and they were about to get even more mad at what would be allowed as the years went on. Moving away from the social change in America, there was about to be extreme political discourse in the United States which adhered to the theme that Americans could never catch a god damn break. As we moved into the 1970s, the economic status of America was simply just “eh”. Nixon took us off the Gold Standard and most Americans were doing just alright. There seemed to be a relatively mediocre time for Americans… until Watergate hit. If you didn’t like the government before because they allowed black people to be involved in society, oh boy you really weren’t going to like them now. After Nixon famously was caught for all the crimes he committed, such as wire tapping into most of his conversations, people’s trust for the government was on the floor.</P>
<P class="p16 ft3">Some of the American people’s trust was gained back by the people with Ford and Carter, two men with one term each who didn’t cause too much riff raff and illuminated normality. The next president up to bat was Reagan who inherited a bad economy and had previously acted in a movie with a chimp. Reagan was a man for the older conservatives and not the middle class or the poor. He chopped down taxes for the rich even though they owed almost 40% of the nation's wealth during his time and cut into programs for the poor such as food stamps and free lunches which directly disproportionately affected African Americans. Reagan’s presidency was an anomaly because you either hated him or you loved him and I believe that’s still true today. How a person views their American freedoms plays a factor in if they loved Reagan or not and that perspective shines a light on Trump and his followers who all seemed to think of freedom the same way as Reagan and his followers. Reagan, despite bringing some economic relief to the American people, could not go out without at least one scandal and in his case it was the <NOBR>Iran-Contra</NOBR> Scandal. This scandal wasn’t a <NOBR>be-all-end-all</NOBR> of how people viewed Reagan but it definitely dropped his ratings at the time. After Reagan we saw the aristocratic George H. W.</P>

<P class="p0 ft4">Bush took office for only one term. Bush was concerned about foreign policy issues more than he was concerned about domestic issues. Eventually losing to Clinton in the 1992 elections, Bush played a main role in his downfall. Being able to end the Cold War and get Iraqian’s out of Kuwait was fantastic and all but being unable to relate to the American people during the Rodney King fiasco and raise taxes when you promised you wouldn’t really put a stall on his reelection campaign. The American people wanted a President for the people so they elected Bill Clinton to be their 43rd president. Bill Clinton cared more about domestic issues than Bush and the people saw a great economic boom during Clinton’s presidency. Just like most American presidents, Clinton could not go out without a scandal either and for him this was the affair he had with intern Monica Lewinsky. Besides this most people don’t have anything bad to say about Clinton’s presidency but most conservative people to this day have a lot to say about the person he was. After Clinton finished out his term George W. Bush took office and before you knew it foreign policy was at the forefront of the government's minds as the tragic events of 9/11 happened just short of 9 months into Bush’s first term. Bush immediately took a stand in the war on terroism and recruited the American people to do the same. His two terms were filled with a focus on winning the war on terroism and ignoring Hurricane Katrina victims who were mostly African American. Towards the end of Bush’s term, the Lehman Brothers Bank went bankrupt and that big old housing bubble, created by the NINJA loans and other factors, burst creating a recession that was almost the worst Americans have ever seen since the Great Depression. Barack Obama got to inherit all of these things when he took office in 2009. Given what he inherited, Obama did pretty well economically. This time it didn’t take us another World War to get out of a financially rough time. Defeating odds, Donald Trump was elected president after losing the popular vote just like Bush and still becoming the president in the 2016 election. <NOBR>Pre-Trump,</NOBR> the Obama era was when the conservatives/republicans really began to run with conspiracies about people that felt like truth to themselves. One of these defining moments was when there was a continuing harping on the idea that Obama was not a U.S. citizen and was actually born in Kenya. It can be argued that Donald Trump becoming president helped fuel fires to these theories as the man wasn’t much of a leader as he was a plain old instigator. The theories of republicans seeming like reality to them and not confirmed facts raged on throughout the years all the way up to right this very second where people believe in Pizzagate, critical race theory not existing, QANON swearing Kamala Harris only became VP to secretly murder Biden to take over the current presidency, and so much more that would hurt my brain to even think about for more than 5 minutes because of how astrologically dumb founded and under factuated they actually are. These theories, along with the pandemic being fueled more by politics and less by science, and so much more we would need 500 pages to write about it are really what put us in the eye of the storm leading up to the insurrection done by these individuals.</P>
<P class="p18 ft3">All of the aforementioned events culminated into one singular point in time on January <NOBR>6th--the</NOBR> storming of the Capitol Building by ardent Donald Trump supporters. It was a moment filled with violence and hate, one fueled by discord and disenfranchisement. Whether comforting or concerning, there is but one simple <NOBR>fact--the</NOBR> history of America proves itself primed for what happened at the Capitol that day. There have been events like it in the past, and there will be events like it in the future. How the hell did we end up here? In a sense, we were born for it, molded in a sense of patriotism and nationalism that leads us to have such a connection to our political party of choice, to believe in the government to help us provide a good life for ourselves or to believe the government should stay away from us as we help ourselves and let them protect us. It is this that shaped those who were at the Capitol that day, both on the outside and the inside. We ended up here of our own will; like Doctor Frankenstein, we have suffered at the hands of a monster of our own creation. The only question <NOBR>remains--will</NOBR> we let this continue to harm us, continue to produce events like that of the 6th? Or will we strive to change what it means to be American, and look past that which divides us?</P>
